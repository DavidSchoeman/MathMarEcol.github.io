Currently about 8% of the ocean is in protected areas. There is a strong push to increase this to 20% or even 30% by 2030. How do we make these new protected areas climate safe? More specificially, how do we ensure that protected areas are resilient to climate change and retaining species within their area of protection? As climate change will impact species differently at different depths in the ocean, can we design new protected area networks that are coherent across ocean depths? We are looking for a student interested in conservation and wants to improve their programming skills.
