Many migratory marine species move over large distances in the ocean, from spawning to feeding regions via migration pathways. During various times in their lifecycle, species are impacted by a suite of anthropogenic stressors. To date, the design of marine protected areas has focused on static information on the distribution of biodiversity, but has generally not included dynamic information on critical habitats, including migratory pathways. This project will design a global network of MPAs that best protect the major feeding, spawning and migration pathways (“ocean highways”) of marine species. We are looking for a student interested in conservation and wants to improve their programming skills.
