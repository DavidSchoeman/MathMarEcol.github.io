Currently about 8% of the ocean is in protected areas. There is a strong push to increase this to 20% or even 30% by 2030. How this could affect fishing – both positively and negatively – is an open question. And how might different fisheries and countries be impacted? This project will use state-of-the-art conservation planning approaches combined with ecosystem modelling to estimate the impact on fisheries. We are looking for a student interested in mathematical ecology and be keen to improve their programming, mathematical and ecological skills.
