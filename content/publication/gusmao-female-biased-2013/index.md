abstract: "Hirst et al. (2013; Mar Ecol Prog Ser 489:297−298) suggest that Gusmão et al. (2013; Mar Ecol Prog Ser 482:279−298) misinterpreted the findings of Hirst et al. (2010; Limnol Oceanogr 55:2193−2206). They restate that the major factors determining sex ratio in pelagic copepods act upon the adult stage, but they place less emphasis on the idea that predation on male copepods is a likely determinant, and highlight the role of physiological longevity. Here we reconsider the data and confirm our position that at present there is limited evidence to support the theory of male-skewed predation. However, we agree that sex determination is governed by a combination of factors, with the relative emphasis being the main point of contention between the 2 parties."
