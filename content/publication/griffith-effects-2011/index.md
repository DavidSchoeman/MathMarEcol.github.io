abstract: "Oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) is altering the carbonate chemistry of seawater, with potentially negative consequences for many calcifying marine organisms. At the same time, increasing ﬁsheries exploitation is impacting on marine ecosystems. Here, using increased benthic-invertebrate mortality as a proxy for effects of ocean acidiﬁcation, the potential impact of the two stressors of ﬁshing and acidiﬁcation on the southeast Australian marine ecosystem to year 2050 was explored. The individual and interaction effects of the two stressors on biomass and diversity were examined for the entire ecosystem and for regional assemblages. For 61 functional groups or species, the cumulative effects of moderate ocean acidiﬁcation and ﬁshing were additive (30%), synergistic (33%), and antagonistic (37%). Strong ocean acidiﬁcation resulted in additive (22%), synergistic (40%), and antagonistic (38%) effects. The greatest impact was on the demersal food web, with ﬁshing impacting predation and acidiﬁcation affecting benthic production. Areas that have been subject to intensive ﬁshing were the most susceptible to acidiﬁcation effect, although ﬁshing also mitigated some of the decline in biodiversity observed with moderate acidiﬁcation. The model suggested that ocean acidiﬁcation and long-term ﬁsheries exploitation could act synergistically with the increasing sensitivity to change from long-term (decades) ﬁsheries exploitation potentially causing unexpected restructuring of the pelagic and demersal food webs. Major regime shifts occur around year 2040. Greater focus is needed on how differential ﬁsheries exploitation of marine resources may exacerbate or accelerate effects of environmental changes such as ocean acidiﬁcation."
