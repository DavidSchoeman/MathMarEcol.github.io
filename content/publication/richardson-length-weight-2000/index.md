abstract: "The diet of marine animals is usually determined by stomach content analysis. Although partially digested prey fragments can often be identified to species level, it is difficult to estimate the original mass of the prey organism. This information, however, is essential for calculating both the total food intake as well as the relative contribution of each prey item. In this study we present regression equations that can be used to estimate the original mass of 18 common South African crustaceans from various indigestible fragments such as the carapace (length and width), chelae (length and width of left and right dactylus) and eye (length and width)."
