abstract: "Since 1951, zooplankton samples have been collected on the shelf along the west coast of South Africa, where pelagic ﬁsh recruit each year. Retrospective analysis of collections made during peak recruitment in austral autumn showed a signiﬁcant increase in the abundance of planktonic crustaceans by two orders of magnitude (from 3.74 103 ind.m 2 in 1951 to 7.03 105 ind.m 2 in 1996). This long-term increase was accompanied by a shift in the community size structure, which parallelled altered regimes of anchovy and sardine, two size-selective planktivores. The increase in crustacean zooplankton could be related to the observed long-term intensiﬁcation of coastal upwelling in the region and a reduction in predation by declining stocks of pelagic ﬁsh over the past four decades."
