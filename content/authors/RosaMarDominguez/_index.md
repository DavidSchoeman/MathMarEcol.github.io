I am a graduate student and my research interests include conservation biology and strategies, and the investigation of ways for humans to sustainably use natural resources in our environment. I am currently researching the velocity of climate change in the ocean and the consequent shifts in species distribution around the African continent and how to integrate these factors into conservation with spatial prioritization. My goal is to design a network of marine protected areas (MPAs) that expand beyond exclusive economic zones (EEZs) and that continue to be effective in the future, even under climate change. I will also use a trophic size-spectra model to explore whether the new patterns of both species distribution and protected areas will affect fisheries and biomass, and how.
