My research interests are diverse, encompassing biogeochemistry, ecotoxicology, and biological oceanography. I specialise in field-based observations and experimental work that supports a variety of modelling approaches (statistical, biogeochemical and ecosystem models) to understand organism responses to environmental change. I work on  a number of Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) programs, including phytoplankton observations for the National Reference Stations, the Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey and the Southern Ocean Time Series.  I use taxonomy-base approaches to study community composition and abundance, integrating my background in ecotoxicology and analytical chemistry to design experimental systems to understand drivers of change in plankton communities.

I have managed commercial phytoplankton labs for monitoring of harmful algae and led NATA accreditation to provide services to the aquaculture industry, State government and industry. I have extensive experience in sediment quality assessments and impacts of aquaculture and other anthropogenic activities on sediment processes and recovery.
My current goals are to learn statistical techniques to work with biological time series and have recently joined the IOC-UNESCO working group to investigate Climate Change and Global Trends of Phytoplankton in the Ocean (Trends PO).
