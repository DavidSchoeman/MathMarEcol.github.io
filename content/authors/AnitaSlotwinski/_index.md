I am a marine biologist and have worked with CSIRO since 2008 as a part of IMOS, the Integrated Marine Observing System. I am a member of the Australian Plankton Survey Team and our focus is to monitor and document changes in plankton communities around Australia. Plankton samples we collect and process provide researchers and policy makers with environmental and climatic indicators, harmful algal bloom detection, eutrophication and pollution information for Australian waters. I am involved in both the Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey and National Reference Stations Project, and assist in laboratory analysis of phytoplankton and zooplankton. I have an interest in plankton taxonomy and am also involved in the development of Australian plankton taxonomic resources and publications.
