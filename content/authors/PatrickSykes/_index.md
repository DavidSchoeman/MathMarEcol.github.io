 I work in the Size Spectra team, researching the role of zooplankton in the transfer of energy from the oceanâ€™s surface layer to its depths. My research uses a mathematical model based on a system of partial differential equations to understand the interactions between organisms of different sizes and functional type. Using this information, we can map out the flow of energy through marine food webs, from phytoplankton to whales.
