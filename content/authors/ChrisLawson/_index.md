Energy affects all aspects of life, ranging from how fast an animal should move to their role in broader ecosystems. My research has focused on the energetics of marine animals, including their diverse strategies to balance energy costs with intake. I am interested in how we can quantify these costs, improve the reliability of modelling energetics, and use this information to predict species and ecosystem responses to changing environmental conditions.
 
I examine trends across species in relation to body morphology, physiology, diet, reproduction and lifestyle, and relate these to habitat use, swimming behaviour and plasticity in responses to environmental change. I use tools such as bioenergetics modelling, hydrodynamic modelling, biologging of wild animals and respirometry experiments of captive animals.
