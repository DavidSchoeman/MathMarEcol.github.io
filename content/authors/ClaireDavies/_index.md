I am an experimental scientist project leading the long term IMOS National Reference Stations sampling program and a member of the Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder survey team. I am a zooplankton and phytoplankton analyst and have a keen interest in encouraging use of the data. I work mostly on the data from these surveys, from wrangling to numerical modelling, to provide products to make this data accessible to researchers. I have been working on providing products for use in Ecosystem modelling to encourage use of observational data in models, creating species distribution maps using statistical models and our survey data and the production of time series products for enhanced visualisation of the data.
 
I am the Dive Officer for Hobart and work on the Handfish monitoring program, diving regularly for this and associated PhD projects.
