Asia Armstrong's PhD research focuses on reef manta ray habitat use and ecology, covering 5 broad topics. Her current thesis chapters are outlined as follows: (1) the use of cleaning stations (visitation frequency, cleaner fish assemblage, site choice etc); (2) the ecological function of these sites (reproductive activity and seasonality, and social network analysis); (3) a global synthesis of sub-lethal threats to reef manta rays via an analysis of the rates and types of injuries (natural and anthropogenic); (4) the global distribution and variation in colour morphs and pattern expression to explore theories about the species evolutionary history and dispersal; and (5) an exploration of reef manta rays feeding ecology via an analysis of the zooplankton environment at their largest aggregation site.
