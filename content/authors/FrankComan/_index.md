I am a marine biologist who has worked at CSIRO since 1988 and has specialised in zooplankton and phytoplankton ecology for the last 10 years. Most of my work is conducted through the plankton monitoring projects funded by IMOS (Integrated Marine Observing System). The two main projects are the Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) Survey and the National Reference Stations (NRS).

My time is split between logistics and sample collection and microscope and computer work back at the laboratory. For AusCPR I assist with preparation of equipment for sampling, working with Ships of opportunity that deploy the equipment and sample preparation and analysis once the samples have been returned to the laboratory. For NRS I assist with logistics for the zooplankton sampling across all stations, field work at the North Stradbroke Island station and laboratory analysis of the plankton samples.
