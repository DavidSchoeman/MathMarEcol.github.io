I have a background in taxonomic identification marine invertebrates and zooplankton and the management of associated data sets and curation of preserved samples. From 2014 I have worked with the IMOS Australian Plankton group identifying zooplankton from the IMOS National Reference Stations and also zooplankton and phytoplankton from continuous plankton recorder silk samples collected for the AUSCPR and SOCPR programs.
