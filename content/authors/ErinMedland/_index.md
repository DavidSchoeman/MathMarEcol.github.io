I am a maths honours student with an interest in applying maths to further our understanding of real-world problems. 

During my honours project I will be working on the Mathematical Marine Ecology Labsâ€™ Zooplankton Size Spectra model (ZooMSSv2). I will explore the system of partial differential equations within the model and analyse the effect of mathematical techniques used to solve these equations. The primary purpose of my project will be to increase the efficiency of the model.
