I am interested in using mathematical modelling to improve our understanding of environmental systems and future conservation strategies.

My research focuses on improving the existing Zooplankton Model of Size Spectra version 2 (ZooMSSv2). I will be working to include better resolution of phytoplankton and primary productivity in the model, as well as expanding the modelled region to include the productive waters over the continental shelves. These changes will hopefully allow us to use outputs from existing Earth System models as inputs to ZooMSS, giving us the ability to examine zooplankton effects on energy transfer under future emission pathways so that we can better understand their impacts on marine life.
