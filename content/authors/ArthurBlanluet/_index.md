I am a marine ecologist, with an interest in the compositions of the intermediate compartments (mesozooplankton, macrozooplankton and micronekton) of the pelagic ecosystems and their interaction with the other components of the ecosystem.

My research has focused on the use of echo-sounder to investigate planktonic layers, compared to more classical sampling tools as nets and trawls, and extrapolate the repartition of these layers on larger scale using predictive numerical models. 

My current research focuses on quantifying the effect of a blue water Marine Protected Area (MPA) on the pelagic ecosystems, using an autonomous surface vehicle: a “Saildrone” (https://www.saildrone.com/) equipped with echo sounders and other oceanographic sensors. Although there has been extensive research conducted on the efficacy of coastal MPAs, there has been little work on the impacts blue water MPAs could have on the open-ocean ecosystems. However, growing areas of open oceans are being protected along the different biodiversity summits. Assessing the influence of these large pelagic MPAs on species of conservation interest (seabirds, marine mammals, etc.) and their prey is capital to highlight the potential of MPAs in conservation of open ocean’s biodiversity.
