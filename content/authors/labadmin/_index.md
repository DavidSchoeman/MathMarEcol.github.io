# Introduction
The Mathematical Marine Ecology Lab uses mathematical, statistical and computational tools to investigate human impacts on our oceans - and to find solutions. By developing models of marine ecosystems based on differential equations and cutting-edge statistical approaches using high-performance computing, we aim to better understand key system drivers, conserve  biodiversity, and ensure productive fisheries under climate change.

The Principal Investigator, Professor Anthony J. Richardson, is a 2018 highly cited researcher in Ecology. He has a joint research position between the School of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Queensland and CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere, Australia's national science provider.

This website introduces our lab, its members, and summarises our activities. If you have a background in mathematics/statistics and want to apply your skills to real-world problems, of if you have a background in ecology and are interested in developing your quantitative skills, then this could be the lab for you. Feel free to contact us - we are always looking for motivated students to join our lab!
