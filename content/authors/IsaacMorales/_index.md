I’m a marine biologist (and a quantitative ecologist) investigating how the velocity of climate change (i.e., the speed and direction of isotherm movement) might influence species’ distribution shifts at different ocean depths and how this phenomenon can inform conservation. 

Ultimately, my research focuses on how best to include climate change in protected areas design.  Designing protected areas in the ocean might be even more challenging than on land. Not only are species moving faster in response to climate change in the ocean, but its 3-D structure adds complexity. Our recent work shows that climate velocity varies with depth and under different climate scenarios. For example, we found climate velocity in the mesopelagic zone is currently half that at the surface, but is projected to more than double under a medium emissions scenario (RCP4.5) by 2100. Moreover, the direction of climate velocity also changes with depth, potentially causing bioregions at different depths. A new paradigm for the design of MPAs in the open ocean is needed – one that considers its 3-D nature, climate change, and different ocean bioregions.
