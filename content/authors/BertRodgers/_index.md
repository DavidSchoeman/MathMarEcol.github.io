I am a marine biology student studying at Swansea University (UK), breaching international waters with a year studying in Australia. The intricate physical and biological processes that shape plankton communities is what interests me, especially physiological adaptation to the progressively changing marine climate.

My current research aims to improve zooplankton modelling by quantifying Q10 values for zooplankton functional groups. Q10 values describe the rate of change of physiological processes with respect to a 10C temperature increase. Q10 values are commonly used in models to parameterise plankton rate processes in different parts of the ocean and in studies of climate change. Plankton communities are particularly susceptible to environmental change, and I hope that this work will be useful for modellers and ecologists that seek to understand plankton dynamics.
