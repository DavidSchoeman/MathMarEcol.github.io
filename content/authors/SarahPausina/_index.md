I am a marine ecologist interested in the ecological health of coastal systems, particularly the effects of enhanced nutrient loading in estuarine waters on plankton communities. My PhD research examines zooplankton dynamics in subtropical Moreton Bay to understand mechanisms controlling zooplankton abundances, biomass and community composition, as well as how they respond to disturbance such as extreme freshwater flows. 

Before returning to study, I worked with Healthy Waterways on the SEQ Regional Water Quality Management Strategy to protect and enhance water quality in the region. I have also been involved in paleolimnological research utilising plankton preserved in sediment profiles to examine ecological regime shifts in response to human disturbance.
