The Principal Investigator, Professor Anthony J. Richardson, is a 2018 highly cited researcher in Ecology. He has a joint research position between the School of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Queensland and CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere, Australia's national science provider.

Anthony runs a dynamic lab at the nexus between mathematics/statistics/computation and marine ecology. His focus is on using mathematical tools to better conserve biodiversity, predict impacts of climate change, and understand the functioning of marine ecosystems. There is a collegial atmosphere in the lab and a critical mass of researchers working on similar problems.

If you have a background in mathematics/statistics and want to apply your skills to real-world problems, of if you have a background in ecology and are interested in developing your quantitative skills, then this could be the lab for you. If you are interested in joining the Mathematical Marine Ecology Lab, then feel free to contact Anthony directly.
