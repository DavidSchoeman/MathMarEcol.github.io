Professor Anthony J. Richardson leads a dynamic and collaborative research group dedicated to using mathematical and computational tools to tackle some of the most pressing challenges in the ocean. His lab focuses on developing models to understand how to conserve marine biodiversity, predict and manage impacts of climate change, and understand the role of plankton in the ocean. He has [authored over 250 scientific papers, been cited more than 35,000 times](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?hl=en&user=RLeJq98AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

The Mathematical Marine Ecology Lab is known for its supportive and collegial atmosphere, with a critical mass of researchers who share a passion for solving real-world ecological problems through quantitative approaches. Lab members benefit from a culture of curiosity, collaboration and innovation, and are encouraged to explore ideas at the interface of conservation, ecology and data science.

If you want to have impact and have a strong quantitative background or are keen to build those skills, then this could be the perfect lab for you. We welcome students and early-career researchers from a wide range of disciplines—including conservation, ecology, mathematics, statistics and computer science—to get in touch and discuss opportunities to work together.

Outside the lab, Anthony enjoys long-distance cycling and is an avid traveller. He has a love for African wildlife, and can often be found exploring game reserves during his holidays.

## Senior Research Fellow
### Dr Jason Everett

::: {.column width="25%"}

:::
::: {.column width="75%"}
Jason is a biological oceanographer, with an interest in how oceanographic processes structure planktonic ecosystems.

His research has focused on how flow regimes, boundary currents, eddies and upwelling events drive changes in the biomass, species distribution and size structure of zooplankton communities. In addition, he have extensive experience working with satellite data and numerical model output.

Jason's current research focus is to quantify how the size, abundance and biomass of zooplankton and fish change across local, regional and global scales. By quantifying the size-based ecosystem through modelling and observations, we can better understand processes such as metabolism, predation or movement, which constrain the role of an individual in its food web. In particular, the biomass and size distribution of zooplankton is poorly understood relative to phytoplankton and fish in our oceans, yet it is critical to understanding the efficiency of energy transfer through to fisheries.

## PhD Students

### Kristine (Tin) Buenafe

::: {.column width="25%"}
<img src="Tin.jpg" style="width: 80%; object-fit: contain"/>
:::
::: {.column width="75%"}
Kristine, better known as Tin, is a quantitative marine ecologist from the Philippines. Although most of her colleagues in her undergraduate degree chose to go into medicine, she took the road less travelled — a path in research... and while most of her colleagues in marine science studied coastal ecosystems, she was more interested in the high seas. Tin has a Master’s degree in [Tropical Biodiversity and Ecosystems (TROPIMUNDO)](https://tropimundo.eu), an Eramus Mundus Joint Master’s Degree program, where she finished first in her batch (Plus Grande Distinction). Tin has developed methods used by conservation practitioners to transition to more climate-smart spatial planning approaches. She’s done this by prioritising protection on climate refugia. In her PhD research, Tin wishes to continue her work on climate change and spatial planning by taking it a step further and developing ways of designing more connected, climate-smart protected area networks.

:::
::: {.column width="75%"}
Sandra is a marine data scientist with an interest in marine spatial planning and ecosystem modelling. She holds a BSc (Hons) in Marine Biology from the University of Plymouth and a MSc in Bioinformatics from the University of Leipzig. Sandra previous experience includes writing R packages and Shiny apps to facilitate stakeholder engagement with time-efficient and reproducible marine spatial planning apps. Her research focuses on designing marine protected areas and assessing their costs and benefits from an ecological and economic perspective. Her PhD will address multiple-use spatial planning in the Global South in a joint project by the University of Queensland and the University of Exeter.

:::
::: {.column width="75%"}
Alvise is a PhD student at the Mathematical Marine Ecology Lab and the Applied Marine Biogeography Lab, supervised by Prof. Anthony Richardson and A/Prof. Daniel Dunn. His research focuses on developing climate-smart and connected spatial prioritisations for mangrove conservation to protect mangrove biodiversity and ecosystem services. He holds an Erasmus Mundus Master’s degree in tropical ecology (TROPIMUNDO). During his thesis, he developed a global study which identifies priority areas for mangrove conservation that maximise ecosystem services. Before starting his PhD at The University of Queensland, he joined the iAtlantic project, funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, developing spatial prioritisations for the conservation of the Atlantic Ocean at the University of Azores.

### Sharad Bayyana

:::
::: {.column width="75%"}
Sharad is a marine biologist who has joined the School of Environment as a PhD candidate. He comes from India, where he was engaged in several marine and wildlife research projects, after completing his master’s in marine biology. He also holds a post-graduate diploma in Remote Sensing and GIS. Back in India, he conducted research at the Wildlife Institute of India, in understanding the spatial ecology of Dugongs, mangroves succession in the Nicobar group of islands after the tsunami of 2004, and coral reef biodiversity assessment of Malvan Marine Sanctuary, along the west coast of India. He has previously worked at the Horniman Museum, London as a visiting researcher, to conduct research on coral reproductive biology and restoration practices. Lately, at Wildlife Conservation Society-India, he was involved in developing data-driven strategies for management practices of Marine Protected Areas along the west coast of India, before moving to Brisbane. For his PhD, he will pursue the implications of climate-driven risks on the biodiversity dynamics under the project “Portfolio projection of biodiversity responses under climate change”. The project aims to quantify adaptive and migration responses as vulnerability metrics, providing resource managers with novel tools to formulate flexible management strategies.

::: {.column width="75%"}
Aharon Fleury completed his Master of Science Biology (Fisheries) program at University of Victoria, Canada in 2016 where he evaluated the reproductive ecology of hagfish off the coast of Vancouver Island. He has since worked five years as an environmental consultant performing ecological and human health risk assessments and modelling the movement of contaminants to humans, plants, and animals via biotic transport pathways. The aim of Aharon’s PhD research is to develop and apply a framework, built on an individual-based model, for environmental impact assessments of marine species that explicitly incorporates connectivity across a migratory cycle and facilitates decision-making by incorporating stakeholder values.

Diego is an interdisciplinary marine ecologist interested in understanding the ecological mechanisms that drive ecosystem health. He foremost focuses on delivering scientific information to improve marine protected areas' conservation outcomes. He is currently investigating elasmobranch migratory connectivity across reefs, and multispecies network models in conservation planning. He is also researching elasmobranch movement using network analysis as a tool to estimate population structures. Finally, his project aims to provide a baseline for shark migratory movement in Australia, strengthening understanding of connectivity within and beyond national jurisdictions.
