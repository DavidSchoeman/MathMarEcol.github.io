# Welcome to the Mathematical Marine Ecology Lab
We use mathematical, statistical, and computational tools to understand and address impacts of human activities on our oceans. By developing advanced models of marine ecosystems and leveraging high-performance computing, our research helps identify the key processes driving ocean change, support biodiversity conservation, and promote sustainable fisheries—particularly in the face of climate change.

Our work sits at the intersection of ecology, oceanography, climate science, and data science, and we collaborate widely to ensure our findings are useful for science, policy, and conservation practice.

# About the Lab Head
Professor Anthony J. Richardson leads the lab and holds a joint position with the School of the Environment at the University of Queensland and CSIRO Environment, Australia’s national science agency. Anthony is a mathematical ecologist whose research is driven by a passion for marine conservation and understanding how climate change is reshaping life in the ocean.

He has authored over 250 scientific papers, been cited more than 35,000 times, and has made significant contributions to our understanding of climate impacts on marine ecosystems—from plankton to fish. His research has also helped shape national and international strategies for marine spatial planning, biodiversity conservation and ecosystem-based management.

# Join Us
This website introduces our lab, our team, current research themes, and opportunities for collaboration. We also list potential research projects for Honours, Masters, and PhD students. If you're excited by marine ecology and keen to build your quantitative skills, we would love to hear from you. We welcome students from a variety of backgrounds, including ecology, mathematics, physics, computer science, and environmental science.

Get in touch—we’re always looking for curious, motivated people to join our team!
