# Welcome

The Mathematical Marine Ecology Lab uses mathematical, statistical and computational tools to investigate human impacts on our oceans - and to find solutions. By developing models of marine ecosystems based on differential equations and cutting-edge statistical approaches using high-performance computing, we aim to better understand key system drivers, conserve biodiversity, and ensure productive fisheries under climate change.

The Principal Investigator, Professor Anthony J. Richardson, is a 2018 highly cited researcher in Ecology. He has a joint research position between the School of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Queensland and CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere, Australiaâ€™s national science provider.

This website introduces our lab, its members, and summarises our activities. If you have a background in mathematics/statistics and want to apply your skills to real-world problems, of if you have a background in ecology and are interested in developing your quantitative skills, then this could be the lab for you. Feel free to contact us - we are always looking for motivated students to join our lab!
