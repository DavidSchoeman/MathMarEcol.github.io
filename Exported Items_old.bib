	abstract = {Large tropical and sub-tropical marine animals must meet their energetic requirements in a largely oligotrophic environment. Many planktivorous elasmobranchs, whose thermal ecologies prevent foraging in nutrient-rich polar waters, aggregate seasonally at predictable locations throughout tropical oceans where they are observed feeding. Here we investigate the foraging and oceanographic environment around Lady Elliot Island, a known aggregation site for reef manta rays Manta alfredi in the southern Great Barrier Reef. The foraging behaviour of reef manta rays was analysed in relation to zooplankton populations and local oceanography, and compared to long-term sighting records of reef manta rays from the dive operator on the island. Reef manta rays fed at Lady Elliot Island when zooplankton biomass and abundance were significantly higher than other times. The critical prey density threshold that triggered feeding was 11.2 mg m-3 while zooplankton size had no significant effect on feeding. The community composition and size structure of the zooplankton was similar when reef manta rays were feeding or not, with only the density of zooplankton changing. Higher zooplankton biomass was observed prior to low tide, and long-term ({\textasciitilde}5 years) sighting data confirmed that more reef manta rays are also observed feeding during this tidal phase than other times. This is the first study to examine prey availability at an aggregation site for reef manta rays and it indicates that they feed in locations and at times of higher zooplankton biomass.},

Understanding how far an animal can move and the extent of its range can inform conservation planning and management. On the east coast of Australia, reef manta rays Mobula alfredi are the subject of a photographic identification study, Project Manta. In June 2018, videos of reef manta rays from the SS Yongala (19.31° S, 147.62° E), were submitted to the Project Manta east coast sightings database. The videos were of two individuals previously identified from North Stradbroke Island (27.42° S, 153.55° E), about 1150 km to the south of the SS Yongala. This represents the greatest point-to-point distance travelled by individual M. afredi and extends the latitudinal range for this sub-population on the east coast. This study highlights that citizen science input can provide valuable data to address knowledge gaps in the distribution and population range of marine species. Knowledge of the 1000+ km range movement potential of individual M. alfredi, highlights the possibility that regional sub-populations may span jurisdictional zones of more countries than previously considered likely, complicating conservation management of this species.},

	abstract = {Marine ecosystems are changing rapidly as the oceans warm and become more acidic. The physical factors and the changes to ocean chemistry that they drive can all be measured with great precision. Changes in the biological composition of communities in different ocean regions are far more challenging to measure because most biological monitoring methods focus on a limited taxonomic or size range. Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has the potential to solve this problem in biological oceanography, as it is capable of identifying a huge phylogenetic range of organisms to species level. Here we develop and apply a novel multi-gene molecular toolkit to eDNA isolated from bulk plankton samples collected over a five-year period from a single site. This temporal scale and level of detail is unprecedented in eDNA studies. We identified consistent seasonal assemblages of zooplankton species, which demonstrates the ability of our toolkit to audit community composition. We were also able to detect clear departures from the regular seasonal patterns that occurred during an extreme marine heatwave. The integration of eDNA analyses with existing biotic and abiotic surveys delivers a powerful new long-term approach to monitoring the health of our world’s oceans in the context of a rapidly changing climate.},

	abstract = {Contemporary impacts of anthropogenic climate change on ecosystems are increasingly being recognized. Documenting the extent of these impacts requires quantitative tools for analyses of ecological observations to distinguish climate impacts in noisy data and to understand interactions between climate variability and other drivers of change. To assist the development of reliable statistical approaches, we review the marine climate change literature and provide suggestions for quantitative approaches in climate change ecology. We compiled 267 peer-reviewed articles that examined relationships between climate change and marine ecological variables. Of the articles with time series data (n = 186), 75\% used statistics to test for a dependency of ecological variables on climate variables. We identiﬁed several common weaknesses in statistical approaches, including marginalizing other important non-climate drivers of change, ignoring temporal and spatial autocorrelation, averaging across spatial patterns and not reporting key metrics. We provide a list of issues that need to be addressed to make inferences more defensible, including the consideration of (i) data limitations and the comparability of data sets; (ii) alternative mechanisms for change; (iii) appropriate response variables; (iv) a suitable model for the process under study; (v) temporal autocorrelation; (vi) spatial autocorrelation and patterns; and (vii) the reporting of rates of change. While the focus of our review was marine studies, these suggestions are equally applicable to terrestrial studies. Consideration of these suggestions will help advance global knowledge of climate impacts and understanding of the processes driving ecological change.},

	abstract = {Stable isotope analysis of tissues with different turnover rates allows for a broader temporal view of a species’ feeding habits. Epidermal mucus is a rapid to medium turnover ‘tissue’ in teleost fish, but its use in elasmobranch dietary studies is unknown. In the present study, we conducted stable isotope analysis on mucus and muscle from the giant manta ray Manta birostris. Mucus d13C values were depleted and closer to surface zooplankton d13C values compared with muscle, whereas there was no significant difference in d15N values between these two tissue types. Using diet tissue discrimination factors from the literature, there was no significant difference in the expected prey profile between muscle and epidermal mucus. However, a broader range in d13C values of expected prey was shown for mucus compared with muscle. The results suggest that if M. birostris mucus is indicative of recent dietary intake, resource use during aggregative behaviour off Ecuador is broader, but with no obvious resource switching. The present study is the first example of using bulk stable isotope analysis to evaluate mucus to investigate feeding ecology in elasmobranchs. However, the time course for the change in mucus isotope signature still needs to be determined through controlled feeding studies in an aquarium setting.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, large planktivorous elasmobranchs have been thought to predominantly feed on surface zooplankton during daytime hours. However, the recent application of molecular methods to examine long-term assimilated diets, has revealed that these species likely gain the majority from deeper or demersal sources. Signature fatty acid analysis (FA) of muscle tissue was used to examine the assimilated diet of the giant manta ray Mobula birostris, and then compared with surface zooplankton that was collected during feeding and non-feeding events at two aggregation sites off mainland Ecuador. The FA profiles of M. birostris and surface zooplankton were markedly different apart from similar proportions of arachidonic acid, which suggests daytime surface zooplankton may comprise a small amount of dietary intake for M. birostris. The FA profile of M. birostris muscle was found to be depleted in polyunsaturated fatty acids, and instead comprised high proportions of 18:1ω9 isomers. While 18:1ω9 isomers are not explicitly considered dietary FAs, they are commonly found in high proportions in deep-sea organisms, including elasmobranch species. Overall, the FA profile of M. birostris suggests a diet that is mesopelagic in origin, but many mesopelagic zooplankton species also vertically migrate, staying deep during the day and moving to shallower waters at night. Here, signature FA analysis is unable to resolve the depth at which these putative dietary items were consumed and how availability of this prey may drive distribution and movements of this large filter-feeder.},

Interactions between physical features and biological assemblages influence ecological processes and the direction and strength of connectivity among Coral Sea ecosystems.

	abstract = {We investigated long-term spatial variability in a number of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) in the northeast Atlantic and North Sea using data from the Continuous Plankton Recorder. Over the last four decades, some dinoﬂagellate taxa showed pronounced variation in the south and east of the North Sea, with the most signiﬁcant increases being restricted to the adjacent waters off Norway. There was also a general decrease along the eastern coast of the United Kingdom. The most prominent feature in the interannual bloom frequencies over the last four decades was the anomalously high values recorded in the late 1980s in the northern and central North Sea areas. The only mesoscale area in the northeast Atlantic to show a signiﬁcant increase in bloom formation over the last decade was the Norwegian coastal region. The changing spatial patterns of HAB taxa and the frequency of bloom formation are discussed in relation to regional climate change, in particular, changes in temperature, salinity, and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Areas highly vulnerable to the effects of regional climate change on HABs are Norwegian coastal waters and the Skagerrak. Other vulnerable areas include Danish coastal waters, and to a lesser extent, the German and Dutch Bight and the northern Irish Sea. Quite apart from eutrophication, our results give a preview of what might happen to certain HAB genera under changing climatic conditions in temperate environments and their responses to variability of climate oscillations such as the NAO.},

	abstract = {Zooplankton are the intermediate trophic level between phytoplankton and ﬁsh, and are an important component of carbon and nutrient cycles, accounting for a large proportion of the energy transfer to pelagic ﬁshes and the deep ocean. Given zooplankton’s importance, models need to adequately represent zooplankton dynamics. A major obstacle, though, is the lack of model assessment. Here we try and stimulate the assessment of zooplankton in models by ﬁlling three gaps. The ﬁrst is that many zooplankton observationalists are unfamiliar with the biogeochemical, ecosystem, size-based and individual-based models that have zooplankton functional groups, so we describe their primary uses and how each typically represents zooplankton. The second gap is that many modelers are unaware of the zooplankton data that are available, and are unaccustomed to the different zooplankton sampling systems, so we describe the main sampling platforms and discuss their strengths and weaknesses for model assessment. Filling these gaps in our understanding of models and observations provides the necessary context to address the last gap—a blueprint for model assessment of zooplankton. We detail two ways that zooplankton biomass/abundance observations can be used to assess models: data wrangling that transforms observations to be more similar to model output; and observation models that transform model outputs to be more like observations. We hope that this review will encourage greater assessment of zooplankton in models and ultimately improve the representation of their dynamics.},

	abstract = {Understanding how external pressures impact ecosystem structure and functioning is essential for ecosystembased approaches to ﬁsheries management. We quantiﬁed the relative effects of ﬁsheries exploitation and environmental conditions on ecological indicators derived from two different data sources, ﬁsheries catch data (catch-based) and ﬁsheries independent survey data (survey-based) for 12 marine ecosystems using a partial least squares path modeling approach (PLS-PM). We linked these ecological indicators to the total biomass of the ecosystem. Although the effects of exploitation and environmental conditions differed across the ecosystems, some general results can be drawn from the comparative approach. Interestingly, the PLS-PM analyses showed that survey-based indicators were less tightly associated with each other than the catch-based ones. The analyses also showed that the effects of environmental conditions on the ecological indicators were predominantly significant, and tended to be negative, suggesting that in the recent period, indicators accounted for changes in environmental conditions and the changes were more likely to be adverse. Total biomass was associated with ﬁsheries exploitation and environmental conditions; however its association with the ecological indicators was weak across the ecosystems. Knowledge of the relative inﬂuence of exploitation and environmental pressures on the dynamics within exploited ecosystems will help us to move towards ecosystem-based approaches to ﬁsheries management. PLS-PM proved to be a useful approach to quantify the relative effects of ﬁsheries exploitation and environmental conditions and suggest it could be used more widely in ﬁsheries oceanography.},

	abstract = {An important challenge for conservation is a quantitative understanding of how multiple human stressors will interact to mitigate or exacerbate global environmental change at a community or ecosystem level. We explored the interaction effects of fishing, ocean warming, and ocean acidification over time on 60 functional groups of species in the southeastern Australian marine ecosystem. We tracked changes in relative biomass within a coupled dynamic whole-ecosystem modeling framework that included the biophysical system, human effects, socioeconomics, and management evaluation. We estimated the individual, additive, and interactive effects on the ecosystem and for five community groups (top predators, fishes, benthic invertebrates, plankton, and primary producers). We calculated the size and direction of interaction effects with an additive null model and interpreted results as synergistic (amplified stress), additive (no additional stress), or antagonistic (reduced stress). Individually, only ocean acidification had a negative effect on total biomass. Fishing and ocean warming and ocean warming with ocean acidification had an additive effect on biomass. Adding fishing to ocean warming and ocean acidification significantly changed the direction and magnitude of the interaction effect to a synergistic response on biomass. The interaction effect depended on the response level examined (ecosystem vs. community). For communities, the size, direction, and type of interaction effect varied depending on the combination of stressors. Top predator and fish biomass had a synergistic response to the interaction of all three stressors, whereas biomass of benthic invertebrates responded antagonistically. With our approach, we were able to identify the regional effects of fishing on the size and direction of the interacting effects of ocean warming and ocean acidification.},

	abstract = {Although sex ratios close to unity are expected in dioecious species, biased sex ratios are common in nature. It is essential to understand causes of skewed sex ratios in situ, as they can lead to mate limitation and have implications for the success of natural populations. Femaleskewed sex ratios are commonly observed in copepods in situ. Here we discuss the challenges of copepod sex ratio research and provide a critical review of factors determining copepod sex ratios, focusing on 2 main objectives. The first is a critique of the male predation theory, which is currently the main process thought to be responsible for female-skewed sex ratios. It assumes that males have higher mortality because of increased vulnerability to predation during their search for mates. We show that there is little support for the male predation theory, that sex ratios skewed toward females occur in the absence of predation, that sex ratios are not related to predation pressure, and that where sex-skewed predation does occur, it is biased toward females. Our second objective is to suggest alternative hypotheses regarding the determination of sex ratios. We demonstrate that environmental factors, environmental sex determination and sex change have strong effects on copepod sex ratios, and suggest that differential physiological longevity of males and females may be more important in determining sex ratios than previously thought. We suggest that copepod sex ratios are the result of a mixture of factors.},

In marine systems, biological indicators such as the range of plankton and ﬁsh have been used to indicate impacts of ocean warming, although for many regions recent ocean warming does not exceed short-term warming events over the last two centuries. Here we use International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) sea-surface temperature data to update analysis in the North Atlantic to show that present warm conditions are currently no more persistent than those encountered in the last 150 years. We show that the position of various isotherms, which play a central role in inﬂuencing the distribution of marine taxa ranging from plankton to ﬁsh and turtles, are more regularly found further north in recent years than at any time since the 1850s.},

	abstract = {Manta rays Manta alfredi are present all year round at Lady Elliot Island (LEI) in the southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia, with peaks in abundance during autumn and winter. Drivers influencing these fluctuations in abundance of M. alfredi at the site remain uncertain. Based on daily count, behavioural, weather and oceanographic data collected over a three-year period, this study examined the link between the relative number of sightings of manta rays at LEI, the biophysical environment, and the habitat use of individuals around the LEI reef using generalised additive models. The response variable in each of the three generalised additive models was number of sightings (per trip at sea) of cruising, cleaning or foraging M. alfredi. We used a set of eleven temporal, meteorological, biological, oceanographic and lunar predictor variables. Results for cruising, cleaning and foraging M. alfredi explained 27.5\%, 32.8\% and 36.3\% of the deviance observed in the respective models and highlighted five predictors (year, day of year, wind speed, chlorophyll-a concentration and fraction of moon illuminated) as common influences to the three models. There were more manta rays at LEI in autumn and winter, slower wind speeds, higher productivity, and around the new and full moon. The winter peak in sightings of foraging M. alfredi was found to precede peaks in cleaning and cruising activity around the LEI reef, which suggests that enhanced food availability may be a principal driver for this seasonal aggregation. A spatial analysis of behavioural observations highlighted several sites around the LEI reef as ‘multi-purpose’ areas where cleaning and foraging activities commonly occur, while the southern end of the reef is primarily a foraging area. The use of extensive citizen science datasets, such as those collected by dive operators in this study, is encouraged as they can provide valuable insights into a species’ ecology.},

	abstract = {Sustained observations allow for the tracking of change in oceanography and ecosystems, however, these are rare, particularly for the Southern Hemisphere. To address this in part, the Australian Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) implemented a network of nine National Reference Stations (NRS). The network builds on one long-term location, where monthly water sampling has been sustained since the 1940s and two others that commenced in the 1950s. In-situ continuously moored sensors and an enhanced monthly water sampling regime now collect more than 50 data streams. Building on sampling for temperature, salinity and nutrients, the network now observes dissolved oxygen, carbon, turbidity, currents, chlorophyll a and both phytoplankton and zooplankton. Additional parameters for studies of ocean acidification and bio-optics are collected at a sub-set of sites and all data is made freely and publically available. Our preliminary results demonstrate increased utility to observe extreme events, such as marine heat waves and coastal flooding; rare events, such as plankton blooms; and have, for the first time, allowed for consistent continental scale sampling and analysis of coastal zooplankton and phytoplankton communities. Independent water sampling allows for cross validation of the deployed sensors for quality control of data that now continuously tracks daily, seasonal and annual variation.},

	abstract = {Tropical marginal seas (TMSs) are natural subregions of tropical oceans containing biodiverse ecosystems with conspicuous, valued, and vulnerable biodiversity assets. They are focal points for global marine conservation because they occur in regions where human populations are rapidly expanding. Our review of 11 TMSs focuses on three key ecosystems—coral reefs and emergent atolls, deep benthic systems, and pelagic biomes—and synthesizes, illustrates, and contrasts knowledge of biodiversity, ecosystem function, interaction between adjacent habitats, and anthropogenic pressures. TMSs vary in the extent that they have been subject to human inﬂuence—from the nearly pristine Coral Sea to the heavily exploited South China and Caribbean Seas—but we predict that they will all be similarly complex to manage because most span multiple national jurisdictions. We conclude that developing a structured process to identify ecologically and biologically signiﬁcant areas that uses a set of globally agreed criteria is a tractable ﬁrst step toward effective multinational and transboundary ecosystem management of TMSs.},

	abstract = {Temporal variability of upwelling activity and primary production is examined for a southeastern Australian upwelling system off the Bonney Coast (36.5uS–38.5uS, 138uE–142uE). Three indices of upwelling activity and primary production are developed based on alongshore wind stress, upwelling plume area (anomalous sea surface temperature), and primary productivity of the upwelling plume (approximated using anomalous chlorophyll a concentration). The majority of the upwelling activity occurs during the austral summer upwelling season from November to March. Interannual variability in the wind forcing for this region shows marginal correspondence to El Nin˜ o–Southern Oscillation variability. Intraseasonal variability followed four distinct phases within the upwelling season of ‘‘onset,’’ ‘‘sustained,’’ ‘‘quiescent,’’ and ‘‘downwelling’’ periods. The Bonney Upwelling is a predictable regional system with temporal variability of its physical forcing that is similar to larger, more intensely studied coastal wind-driven upwelling systems. However, we find that the Bonney Coast is a low wind-forced upwelling region compared to other upwelling systems. Simple linear quantitative models developed between upwelling activity predictors (wind and upwelling plume area) and the biological response (chlorophyll a) explain 40–50\% of the seasonal variability of approximated phytoplankton productivity along the Bonney Coast. As primary productivity in a low-wind system is not affected by the deleterious effects of turbulence and advection, these simple models are able to predict chlorophyll variability in the Bonney region. Models developed in this study provide a method of assessing the effect of decadal or longer variability of chlorophyll concentration in low wind-forcing upwelling systems at regional and global scales.},

Daily sampling demonstrated the importance of advective processes driven by meteorological forcing in controlling rapid shifts in the biomass and species composition of the phytoplankton community. Samples of similar phytoplankton composition were associated with different stages of the upwelling cycle, as defined by an index of biological ageing of upwelled waters. Relationships between the physical, chemical and biologicalfieldswere defined from time-senes measurements. The time elapsed following upwelling, required for the determination of biological rates, was estimated from the rate of heating. A primary production estimate of 2.14 g C nv2 day{\textasciicircum} was derived from determination of the rate of nutrient depletion, whereas a phytoplankton biomass-nutrient consumption equation provided an estimate of 3 92 g C m 2 day"'.

	abstract = {Climate change is driving changes in the physical and chemical properties of the ocean that have consequences for marine ecosystems. Here, we review evidence for the responses of marine life to recent climate change across ocean regions, from tropical seas to polar oceans. We consider observed changes in calciﬁcation rates, demography, abundance, distribution, and phenology of marine species. We draw on a database of observed climate change impacts on marine species, supplemented with evidence in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We discuss factors that limit or facilitate species’ responses, such as ﬁshing pressure, the availability of prey, habitat, light and other resources, and dispersal by ocean currents. We ﬁnd that general trends in species’ responses are consistent with expectations from climate change, including shifts in distribution to higher latitudes and to deeper locations, advances in spring phenology, declines in calciﬁcation, and increases in the abundance of warm-water species. The volume and type of evidence associated with species responses to climate change is variable across ocean regions and taxonomic groups, with predominance of evidence derived from the heavily-studied north Atlantic Ocean. Most investigations of the impact of climate change being associated with the impacts of changing temperature, with few observations of effects of changing oxygen, wave climate, precipitation (coastal waters), or ocean acidiﬁcation. Observations of species responses that have been linked to anthropogenic climate change are widespread, but are still lacking for some taxonomic groups (e.g., phytoplankton, benthic invertebrates, marine mammals).},

Due to the large gap between the two satellite eras and differences in sensor characteristics, comparison of the absolute values retrieved from the two instruments remains challenging. Using a unique in situ ocean colour dataset that spans more than half a century, the two satellite-derived chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) eras are linked to assess concurrent changes in phytoplankton variability and bloom timing over the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and North Sea. Results from this unique re-analysis reﬂect a clear increasing pattern of Chl-a, a merging of the two seasonal phytoplankton blooms producing a longer growing season and higher seasonal biomass, since the mid-1980s. The broader climate plays a key role in Chl-a variability as the ocean colour anomalies parallel the oscillations of the Northern Hemisphere Temperature (NHT) since 1948.},

	abstract = {The fecundity and somatic growth rates of Calanus agulhensis and Calanoides carinatus, the dominant large calanoid copepods in the southern Benguela upwelling system, as well as the fecundity of several other common copepods, were measured between September and March of 1993/94 and 1994/95. Mean egg production of most copepods was low at {\textless}30 eggs female"1 day1 \{\vphantom{\}}Calanoides carinatus 23.7, Calanus agulhensis 19.0, Neocalanus tonsus 16.1 and Rhincalanus nasutus 26.1), whereas the mean fecundity of Centropages brachiatus was significantly greater (83.6 eggs female"1 day1). This study also presents the first comprehensive field estimates of the fecundity of Nannocalanus minor (mean: 26.1 eggs female"1 day1, range: 0.0-96.2 eggs female"1 day1) and of somatic growth of N6 and all copepodite stages of Calanoides carinatus (decreasing from 0.58 day1 for N6 to 0.04 day1 for C5). Somatic growth rates of Calanus agulhensis also declined with age: from 0.57 day1 for N6 to 0.09 day1 for C5. Data on growth rates were used to assess the relative importance of food [as measured by total chlorophyll (Chi) a concentration], phytoplankton cell size (proportion of cells {\textgreater}10 urn) and temperature to the growth of copepods. Multiple regression results suggested that fecundity and somatic growth rates were positively related to both Chi a concentration and phytoplankton cell size, but not to temperature. Although it was not possible to separate the effects of Chi a concentration and phytoplankton cell size, data from previous laboratory experiments suggest that copepod growth is not limited by small cells per se, but by the low Chi a concentrations that are associated with these particles in thefield.Despite growth not being directly related to temperature, a domeshaped relationship was evident in some species, with slower growth rates at cool ({\textless}13°C) and warm ({\textgreater}18°C) temperatures. The shape of this relationship mirrors that of Chi a versus temperature, where poor Chi a concentrations are associated with cool and warm temperatures. It is concluded that the effect of food limitation on growth of copepods outweighs that of temperature in the southern Benguela region. Sources of variability in relationships between growth and Chi a concentration are discussed.},

I begin by describing the importance of zooplankton in ocean ecosystems and the attributes that make them sensitive beacons of climate change. Global warming may have even greater repercussions for marine ecosystems than for terrestrial ecosystems, because temperature inﬂuences water column stability, nutrient enrichment, and the degree of new production, and thus the abundance, size composition, diversity, and trophic efﬁciency of zooplankton. Pertinent descriptions of physical changes in the ocean in response to climate change are given as a prelude to a detailed discussion of observed impacts of global warming on zooplankton. These manifest as changes in the distribution of individual species and assemblages, in the timing of important life-cycle events, and in abundance and community structure. The most illustrative case studies, where climate has had an obvious, tangible impact on zooplankton and substantial ecosystem consequences, are presented. Changes in the distribution and phenology of zooplankton are faster and greater than those observed for terrestrial groups. Relevant projected changes in ocean conditions are then presented, followed by an exploration of potential future changes in zooplankton communities from the perspective of different modelling approaches. Researchers have used a range of modelling approaches on individual species and functional groups forced by output from climate models under future greenhouse gas emission scenarios. I conclude by suggesting some potential future directions in climate change research for zooplankton, viz. the use of richer zooplankton functional groups in ecosystem models; greater research effort in tropical systems; investigating climate change in conjunction with other human impacts; and a global zooplankton observing system.},

However, it is often difﬁcult to extract interpretable patterns from satellite images, as data sets are large and often non-linear. In this methodological paper, we describe the self-organizing map (SOM), a type of artiﬁcial neural network adept at pattern identiﬁcation. The ability of the SOM to extract patterns from a variety of satellite data, including scatterometer and thermal imagery, is illustrated by example. We characterize inter-annual, seasonal and event-scale variability by using the SOM and relate the output to auxillary variables by using a number of techniques that enhance interpretation. Practical recommendations for the fruitful application of SOMs are given. Although the SOM has only rarely been used in oceanography previously, it is a promising applied mathematical tool for pattern extraction from many types of data, especially large and complex satellite data sets.},

These data have been used in many studies to elucidate seasonal patterns and long-term change in plankton populations, as well as more recently to validate ecosystem models. There has, however, been relatively little comparison of the data from the CPR with that from other samplers. In this study we compare zooplankton abundance estimated from the CPR in the northeast Atlantic with near-surface samples collected by a Longhurst-Hardy Plankton Recorder (LHPR) at Ocean Weather Station India (59 N, 19 W) between 1971 and 1975. Comparisons were made for six common copepods in the region: Acartia clausi, Calanus ﬁnmarchicus, Euchaeta norvegica, Metridia lucens, Oithona sp., and Pleuromamma robusta. Seasonal cycles based on CPR data were similar to those recorded by the LHPR. Differences in absolute abundances were apparent, however, with the CPR underestimating abundances by a factor of between 5 and 40, with the exception of A. clausi. Active avoidance by zooplankton is thought to be responsible. This avoidance is species speciﬁc, so that care must be taken describing communities, as the CPR emphasises those species that are preferentially caught, a problem common to many plankton samplers.},

	abstract = {The continuous plankton recorder (CPR) survey is the largest multi-decadal plankton monitoring programme in the world. It was initiated in 1931 and by the end of 2004 had counted 207,619 samples and identiﬁed 437 phyto- and zooplankton taxa throughout the North Atlantic. CPR data are used extensively by the research community and in recent years have been used increasingly to underpin marine management. Here, we take a critical look at how best to use CPR data. We ﬁrst describe the CPR itself, CPR sampling, and plankton counting procedures. We discuss the spatial and temporal biases in the Survey, summarise environmental data that have not previously been available, and describe the new data access policy. We supply information essential to using CPR data, including descriptions of each CPR taxonomic entity, the idiosyncrasies associated with counting many of the taxa, the logic behind taxonomic changes in the Survey, the semi-quantitative nature of CPR sampling, and recommendations on choosing the spatial and temporal scale of study. This forms the basis for a broader discussion on how to use CPR data for deriving ecologically meaningful indices based on size, functional groups and biomass that can be used to support research and management. This contribution should be useful for plankton ecologists, modellers and policy makers that actively use CPR data.},

	abstract = {Whale sharks Rhincodon typus are globally threatened, but a lack of biological and demographic information hampers an accurate assessment of their vulnerability to further decline or capacity to recover. We used laser photogrammetry at two aggregation sites to obtain more accurate size estimates of free-swimming whale sharks compared to visual estimates, allowing improved estimates of biological parameters. Individual whale sharks ranged from 432–917 cm total length (TL) (mean ± SD = 673 ± 118.8 cm, N = 122) in southern Mozambique and from 420–990 cm TL (mean ± SD = 641 ± 133 cm, N = 46) in Tanzania. By combining measurements of stranded individuals with photogrammetry measurements of free-swimming sharks, we calculated length at 50\% maturity for males in Mozambique at 916 cm TL. Repeat measurements of individual whale sharks measured over periods from 347–1,068 days yielded implausible growth rates, suggesting that the growth increment over this period was not large enough to be detected using laser photogrammetry, and that the method is best applied to estimating growth rates over longer (decadal) time periods. The sex ratio of both populations was biased towards males (74\% in Mozambique, 89\% in Tanzania), the majority of which were immature (98\% in Mozambique, 94\% in Tanzania). The population structure for these two aggregations was similar to most other documented whale shark aggregations around the world. Information on small ({\textless}400 cm) whale sharks, mature individuals, and females in this region is lacking, but necessary to inform conservation initiatives for this globally threatened species.},

            Rhincodon typus
            is an endangered, highly migratory species with a wide, albeit patchy, distribution through tropical oceans. Ten aerial survey flights along the southern Mozambican coast, conducted between 2004–2008, documented a relatively high density of whale sharks along a {\textasciitilde}200 km stretch of the Inhambane Province, with a pronounced hotspot adjacent to Praia do Tofo. To examine the residency and movement of whale sharks in coastal areas around Praia do Tofo, where they may be more susceptible to gill net entanglement, we tagged 15 juveniles with SPOT5 satellite tags and tracked them for 2–88 days (mean = 27 days) as they dispersed from this area. Sharks travelled between 10 and 2,737 km (mean = 738 km) at a mean horizontal speed of 28 ± 17.1 SD km day
            -1
            . While several individuals left shelf waters and travelled across international boundaries, most sharks stayed in Mozambican coastal waters over the tracking period. We tested for whale shark habitat preferences, using sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-
            a
            concentration and water depth as variables, by computing 100 random model tracks for each real shark based on their empirical movement characteristics. Whale sharks spent significantly more time in cooler, shallower water with higher chlorophyll-
            a
            concentrations than model sharks, suggesting that feeding in productive coastal waters is an important driver of their movements. To investigate what this coastal habitat choice means for their conservation in Mozambique, we mapped gill nets during two dedicated aerial surveys along the Inhambane coast and counted gill nets in 1,323 boat-based surveys near Praia do Tofo. Our results show that, while whale sharks are capable of long-distance oceanic movements, they can spend a disproportionate amount of time in specific areas, such as along the southern Mozambique coast. The increasing use of large-mesh gill nets in this coastal hotspot for whale sharks is likely to be a threat to regional populations of this iconic species.},

	abstract = {Global ecosystem models are essential tools for predicting climate change impacts on marine systems. Modeled biogenic carbon fluxes in the ocean often match measured data poorly and part of this could be because small copepods ({\textless}2 mm) are modeled as unicellular feeders grazing on phytoplankton and microzooplankton. The most abundant copepods from a seasonal upwelling region of the Eastern North Atlantic were sorted, and a molecular method was applied to copepod gut contents to evaluate the extent of metazoan predation under two oceanographic conditions, a trophic pathway not accounted for in global models. Scaling up the results obtained herein, based on published field and laboratory estimates, suggests that small copepods could ingest 1.79–27.20 gigatons C/year globally. This ignored metazoan‐copepod link could increase current estimates of biogeochemical fluxes (remineralization, respiration, and the biological pump) and export to higher trophic levels by 15.6\%–24.4\%. It could also account for global discrepancies between measured daily ingestion and copepod metabolic demand/growth. The inclusion of metazoan predation into global models could provide a more realistic role of the copepods in the ocean and if these preliminary data hold true at larger sample sizes and scales, the implications would be substantial at the global scale.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of nutrients, phytoplankton, zooplankton and water clarity of the iconic Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA) are inﬂuenced by seasonal variation in coastal and oceanic conditions, and anthropogenic inputs. We use the 3-dimensional coupled catchment-hydrodynamic-sediment-wave-optical-biogeochemical eReefs model to hindcast nutrient and planktonic responses to changes in seasonal and annual variability over a six-year period (2011–2016). In this paper we present a comparison of the eReefs model conducted against a range of in situ observations that included 24 water quality moorings, 2 nutrient sampling programs (with a total of 18 stations) and time-series of taxon-speciﬁc plankton abundance. At 14 near-coastal stations the simulated chlorophyll a (Chl a), when compared with chlorophyll extractions from water samples, had an average root mean square (RMS) error of 0.30 mg m−3 and a Willmott index of 0.59. For the same sites, simulated turbidity, when compared with turbidity sensors, had a Willmott index of 0.58 and simulated nitrate + nitrite had a Willmott index of 0.41 when compared with tri-annual water samples. Comparison with a spatially-resolved statistical model of zooplankton based on {\textgreater} 900 observations in the region showed similarities in the relationship and spatial distribution of simulated and observed biomass, where both show zooplankton biomass is greatest inshore, biomass is highest around shallow reef areas and in the southern and central GBRWHA, and greater in summer than winter. Additionally, we investigate planktonic and nutrient responses to climatic variation. The ﬁrst two years of the simulation coincided with La Niña events that drive greater than average winds, rainfall and river discharge. Throughout all years, simulated Chl a increases from north to south and from outer to inner coastal regions. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen, primary production and phytoplankton biomass were higher during La Niña in inshore and mid-shelf waters, while oﬀshore regions were similar in all years from 2011 to 2016. Simulated Secchi depth was deeper oﬀshore and decreased from oﬀshore to inner coastal regions and from north to south. The eReefs simulation contributes to the understanding at a high spatial and temporal resolution of where and how nutrients and plankton originate and interact within the Great Barrier Reef.},

	abstract = {Historical harvesting pushed many whale species to the brink of extinction. Although most Southern Hemisphere populations are slowly recovering, the influence of future climate change on their recovery remains unknown. We investigate the impacts of two anthropogenic pressures—historical commercial whaling and future climate change—on populations of baleen whales (blue, fin, humpback, Antarctic minke, southern right) and their prey (krill and copepods) in the Southern Ocean. We use a climate–biological coupled “Model of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem Assessments” (MICE) that links krill and whale population dynamics with climate change drivers, including changes in ocean temperature, primary productivity and sea ice. Models predict negative future impacts of climate change on krill and all whale species, although the magnitude of impacts on whales differs among populations. Despite initial recovery from historical whaling, models predict concerning declines under climate change, even local extinctions by 2100, for Pacific populations of blue, fin and southern right whales, and Atlantic/Indian fin and humpback whales. Predicted declines were a consequence of reduced prey (copepods/krill) from warming and increasing interspecific competition between whale species. We model whale population recovery under an alternative scenario whereby whales adapt their migratory patterns to accommodate changing sea ice in the Antarctic and a shifting prey base. Plasticity in range size and migration was predicted to improve recovery for ice‐associated blue and minke whales. Our study highlights the need for ongoing protection to help depleted whale populations recover, as well as local management to ensure the krill prey base remains viable, but this may have limited success without immediate action to reduce emissions.},

	abstract = {Siphonophores are colonial hydrozoans that feed on zooplankton including ﬁsh larvae, and occur throughout the world’s oceans from surface waters to ocean depths. Here we describe the composition of hyponeustonic siphonophores (0– 3 m depth) from the tropical Colombian Paciﬁc Ocean based on 131 plankton samples collected between June –October from 2001–2004. Samples were dominated by species of Calycophorae, with only three species of Physonectae identiﬁed, consistent with their deeper depth distribution. Muggiaea atlantica, Chelophyes contorta, Diphyes dispar, and Eudoxoides mitra were the most common of the 21 species identiﬁed. We found moderate structuring of the siphonophore community by the salinity gradient from inshore to offshore, and greater richness during the night because of diel vertical migration. Temperature did not play a signiﬁcant role in structuring siphonophore communities, perhaps because of the narrow temperature range observed (3.5 8C). We extend the known temperature and salinity range of several species, including M. atlantica up to temperatures of 28.6 8C and salinities down to 24.7. Interestingly, only polygastric stages of M. atlantica were found, suggesting the reproductive stage of M. atlantica in tropical waters might be found in deeper waters. Chelophyes appendiculata was rare in our study and C. contorta was common, providing evidence they have a potential allopatric relationship, with C. contorta replacing C. appendiculata in warm water. Finally, we found siphonophore abundance was positively related to the abundance of copepods and ﬁsh eggs, with the top 13 most abundant species all having positive correlations, suggesting siphonophore abundances are tightly controlled by their food.},

	abstract = {Two new species of small hydromedusae were found during routine monitoring in coastal waters of eastern Australia and are here described. The first, Melicertissa antrichardsoni Uribe-Palomino \& Gershwin, sp. n., from Moreton Bay, Queensland, is placed in its genus because of its possession of both cordyli and eight-fold symmetry. It differs from its congeners in two conspicuous features: firstly, having small, oval split gonads located adjacent to the base of the stomach, and secondly, in its extremely small size at maturity (2 mm bell diameter, compared to the next smallest species at 7 mm). Moreover, it possesses a unique combination of other characters. This species appears to be endemic to Moreton Bay. The second new species, Paralovenia yongalensis Gershwin \& Uribe-Palomino, sp. n., from the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, is placed in its genus because of its two opposite normal tentacles and two opposite marginal clusters of cirri. It differs from its congeners primarily in a more rounded body than the others; the shape, length, and position of its short spindle-shaped, distal gonads; possession of subumbrellar nematocyst clusters; and possession of statocysts. These discoveries bring the total number of Melicertissa species to eight and the total number of Paralovenia species to three. The discovery of these two micromedusae underscores the need for further examination of the often-ignored minute and/or gelatinous fauna.},

Retrospective analysis of collections made during peak recruitment in austral autumn showed a signiﬁcant increase in the abundance of planktonic crustaceans by two orders of magnitude (from 3.74 103 ind.m 2 in 1951 to 7.03 105 ind.m 2 in 1996). This long-term increase was accompanied by a shift in the community size structure, which parallelled altered regimes of anchovy and sardine, two size-selective planktivores. The increase in crustacean zooplankton could be related to the observed long-term intensiﬁcation of coastal upwelling in the region and a reduction in predation by declining stocks of pelagic ﬁsh over the past four decades.},

Impacts can be caused by local stressors which can be managed, such as eutrophication, and by global stressors that cannot be managed, such as climate change. Cumulative impact maps typically assume that there are no interactive effects between stressors on biodiversity. However, the beneﬁts of managing the ecosystem are affected by interactions between stressors. Our aim was to determine whether the assumption of no interactions in impact maps leads to incorrect identiﬁcation of sites for management.},

	abstract = {Artisanal fisheries support millions of livelihoods worldwide, yet ineffective enforcement can allow for continued environmental degradation due to overexploitation. Here, we use spatial planning to design an enforcement strategy for a pre-existing spatial closure for artisanal fisheries considering climate variability, existing seasonal fishing closures, representative conservation targets and enforcement costs. We calculated enforcement cost in three ways, based on different assumptions about who could be responsible for monitoring the fishery. We applied this approach in the Patos Lagoon estuary (Brazil), where we found three important results. First, spatial priorities for enforcement were similar under different climate scenarios. Second, we found that the cost and percentage of area enforced varied among scenarios tested by the conservation planning analysis, with only a modest increase in budget needed to incorporate climate variability. Third, we found that spatial priorities for enforcement depend on whether enforcement is carried out by a central authority or by the community itself. Here, we demonstrated a method that can be used to efficiently design enforcement plans, resulting in the conservation of biodiversity and estuarine resources. Also, cost of enforcement can be potentially reduced when fishers are empowered to enforce management within their fishing grounds.},

	abstract = {Mesoscale eddies are ubiquitous features of ocean circulation that modulate the supply of nutrients to the upper sunlit ocean, influencing the rates of carbon fixation and export. The popular eddy-pumping paradigm implies that nutrient fluxes are enhanced in cyclonic eddies because of upwelling inside the eddy, leading to higher phytoplankton production. We show that this view does not hold for a substantial portion of eddies within oceanic subtropical gyres, the largest ecosystems in the ocean. Using space-based measurements and a global biogeochemical model, we demonstrate that during winter when subtropical eddies are most productive, there is increased chlorophyll in anticyclones compared with cyclones in all subtropical gyres (by 3.6 to 16.7\% for the five basins). The model suggests that this is a consequence of the modulation of winter mixing by eddies. These results establish a new paradigm for anticyclonic eddies in subtropical gyres and could have important implications for the biological carbon pump and the global carbon cycle.},

	abstract = {Irukandji stings are a leading occupational health and safety issue for marine industries in tropical Australia and an emerging problem elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific and Caribbean. Their mild initial sting frequently results in debilitating illness, involving signs of sympathetic excess including excruciating pain, sweating, nausea and vomiting, hypertension and a feeling of impending doom; some cases also experience acute heart failure and pulmonary oedema. These jellyfish are typically small and nearly invisible, and their infestations are generally mysterious, making them scary to the general public, irresistible to the media, and disastrous for tourism. Research into these fascinating species has been largely driven by the medical profession and focused on treatment. Biological and ecological information is surprisingly sparse, and is scattered through grey literature or buried in dispersed publications, hampering understanding. Given that long-term climate forecasts tend toward conditions favourable to jellyfish ecology, that long-term legal forecasts tend toward increasing duty-of-care obligations, and that bioprospecting opportunities exist in the powerful Irukandji toxins, there is a clear need for information to help inform global research and robust management solutions. We synthesise and contextualise available information on Irukandji taxonomy, phylogeny, reproduction, vision, behaviour, feeding, distribution, seasonality, toxins, and safety. Despite Australia dominating the research in this area, there are probably well over 25 species worldwide that cause the syndrome and it is an understudied problem in the developing world. Major gaps in knowledge are identified for future research: our lack of clarity on the socio-economic impacts, and our need for time series and spatial surveys of the species, make this field particularly enticing.},

They are also heavily exploited and, as a result, are the focus of numerous spatial planning initiatives. Over the past decade, there has been increasing enthusiasm for protected areas as a tool for pelagic conservation, however, few have been implemented. Here we demonstrate an approach to plan protected areas that address the physical and biological dynamics typical of the pelagic realm. Specifically, we provide an example of an approach to planning protected areas that integrates pelagic and benthic conservation in the southern Benguela and Agulhas Bank ecosystems off South Africa. Our aim was to represent species of importance to fisheries and species of conservation concern within protected areas. In addition to representation, we ensured that protected areas were designed to consider pelagic dynamics, characterized from time-series data on key oceanographic processes, together with data on the abundance of small pelagic fishes. We found that, to have the highest likelihood of reaching conservation targets, protected area selection should be based on time-specific data rather than data averaged across time. More generally, we argue that innovative methods are needed to conserve ephemeral and dynamic pelagic biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) is altering the carbonate chemistry of seawater, with potentially negative consequences for many calcifying marine organisms. At the same time, increasing ﬁsheries exploitation is impacting on marine ecosystems. Here, using increased benthic-invertebrate mortality as a proxy for effects of ocean acidiﬁcation, the potential impact of the two stressors of ﬁshing and acidiﬁcation on the southeast Australian marine ecosystem to year 2050 was explored. The individual and interaction effects of the two stressors on biomass and diversity were examined for the entire ecosystem and for regional assemblages. For 61 functional groups or species, the cumulative effects of moderate ocean acidiﬁcation and ﬁshing were additive (30\%), synergistic (33\%), and antagonistic (37\%). Strong ocean acidiﬁcation resulted in additive (22\%), synergistic (40\%), and antagonistic (38\%) effects. The greatest impact was on the demersal food web, with ﬁshing impacting predation and acidiﬁcation affecting benthic production. Areas that have been subject to intensive ﬁshing were the most susceptible to acidiﬁcation effect, although ﬁshing also mitigated some of the decline in biodiversity observed with moderate acidiﬁcation. The model suggested that ocean acidiﬁcation and long-term ﬁsheries exploitation could act synergistically with the increasing sensitivity to change from long-term (decades) ﬁsheries exploitation potentially causing unexpected restructuring of the pelagic and demersal food webs. Major regime shifts occur around year 2040. Greater focus is needed on how differential ﬁsheries exploitation of marine resources may exacerbate or accelerate effects of environmental changes such as ocean acidiﬁcation.},

              A massive central Australian dust storm in September 2009 was associated with abundant fungal spores (150,000/m
              3
              ) and hyphae in coastal waters between Brisbane (27°S) and Sydney (34°S). These spores were successfully germinated from formalin-preserved samples, and using molecular sequencing of three different genes (the large subunit rRNA gene [LSU], internal transcribed spacer [ITS[, and beta-tubulin gene), they were conclusively identified as
              Aspergillus sydowii
              , an organism circumstantially associated with gorgonian coral fan disease in the Caribbean. Surprisingly, no human health or marine ecosystem impacts were associated with this Australian dust storm event. Australian fungal cultures were nontoxic to fish gills and caused a minor reduction in the motility of
              Alexandrium
              or
              Chattonella
              algal cultures but had their greatest impacts on
              Symbiodinium
              dinoflagellate coral symbiont motility, with hyphae being more detrimental than spores. While we have not yet seen any soft coral disease outbreaks on the Australian Great Barrier Reef similar to those observed in the Caribbean and while this particular fungal population was non- or weakly pathogenic, our observations raise the possibility of future marine ecosystem pathogen impacts from similar dust storms harboring more pathogenic strains.},

	abstract = {Dust has been widely recognised as an important source of nutrients in the marine environment and as a vector for transporting pathogenic microorganisms. Disturbingly, in the wake of a dust storm event along the eastern Australian coast line in 2009, the Continuous Plankton Recorder collected masses of fungal spores and mycelia ({\textasciitilde}150,000 spores/m3) forming a ﬂoating raft that covered a coastal area equivalent to 25 times the surface of England. Cultured A. sydowii strains exhibited varying metabolite proﬁles, but all produced sydonic acid, a chemotaxonomic marker for A. sydowii. The Australian marine fungal strains share major metabolites and display comparable metabolic diversity to Australian terrestrial strains and to strains pathogenic to Caribbean coral. Secondary colonisation of the rafts by other fungi, including strains of Cladosporium, Penicillium and other Aspergillus species with distinct secondary metabolite proﬁles, was also encountered. Our bioassays revealed that the dust-derived marine fungal extracts and known A. sydowii metabolites such as sydowic acid, sydowinol and sydowinin A adversely affect photophysiological performance (Fv/Fm) of the coral reef dinoﬂagellate endosymbiont Symbiodinium. Different Symbiodinium clades exhibited varying sensitivities, mimicking sensitivity to coral bleaching phenomena. The detection of such large amounts of A. sydowii following this dust storm event has potential implications for the health of coral environments such as the Great Barrier Reef.},

Under non-limiting food conditions, egg production by both species increased linearly with temperatures between 9°C and 18°C. Egg production by C. carinatus was relatively faster at 21°C, but was offset by greater mortality. Both species showed similar functional responses to food concentration in the field, reaching satiation at {\textasciitilde}15mg Chl a m–3, or {\textasciitilde}3–4ppm. Food abundance was the most important predictor of egg production, whether measured as Chl a or as particle volume. Both species preferred larger particles that dominated the biomass peak, but particle size appeared more important for C. carinatus, with increasingly faster rates of egg production as the proportion of large cells ({\textgreater}10μm) exceeded 50\%, and slower ingestion of small ({\textless}10μm) cells. Omnivory may be more important to C. agulhensis. Niche separation between the two species appears unrelated to temperature, food abundance or diel vertical migratory behaviour, and is more likely a function of variability in food availability, although food size may also play a role.},

The CPR time series is unique to the North Atlantic region as a validation tool. Data were extracted from the model to correspond with those collected by the CPR survey, and both the model and survey plankton data were standardised to allow the comparison of model biomass with survey counts. Simple linear regression and absolute error maps provide a qualitative evaluation of spatio-temporal model performance of simulated diatoms, flagellates, total phytoplankton and omnivorous mesozooplankton. Comparisons of z-scores indicate that the model reproduces the main pelagic seasonal features, and there is good correlation between magnitudes of these features with respect to standard deviations from a long-term mean. The model is replicating up to 62\% of the mesozooplankton seasonality across the domain, with variable results for the phytoplankton. There are, however, differences in the timing of patterns in plankton seasonality. The validation exercise has highlighted that the spring diatom bloom in the model is too early, suggesting the need to reparameterise the response of phytoplankton to changing light levels in the model. Errors in the north and west of the domain imply that model turbulence and vertical density structure need to be improved to more accurately capture plankton dynamics.},

	abstract = {Marine zooplankton must deal with seasonal variations of the upper-ocean environment that are both intense and prolonged compared to their life spans. This leads to large seasonal ﬂuctuations of population size, and strong evolutionary tuning of demographic processes (e.g. reproduction, somatic and population growth, and dormancy) for optimal match with the average annual alternation between good and poor growing conditions. However, neither environmental nor zooplankton seasonal cycles are exactly repetitive year-to-year. Recent analyses of several long zooplankton time series have found large (1–3 months) interannual variability of seasonal timing. In this paper, we compare and synthesize results from these studies. Variability in zooplankton phenology is often correlated with anomalies of one or more environmental variables. The most common phenology correlate is water temperature during and before the growing season, and the most common phenologic response to temperature is ‘‘earlier when and where warmer’’. But several species with seasonal maxima in late summer or autumn have a clear ‘‘later when warmer’’ response. Covariance of seasonal timing with temperature must therefore involve more than thermal acceleration of physiological rates. We suggest that water temperature (relatively slowly and smoothly varying in aquatic environments) is also used by zooplankton as a timing cue, much as terrestrial biota uses day-length. During recent warming trends, temperature-linked changes in seasonal timing may have moved some species outside their locally-optimal seasonal windows (e.g. Calanus ﬁnmarchicus in the North Sea, and Pseudocalanus elongatus in the Adriatic), and have been a major contributor to changes in community composition. Between-location similarities of zooplankton phenology and temperature anomaly time series decay with increasing site-to-site spatial separation. The decorrelation scale is several thousand kilometers in the subarctic Paciﬁc, but a thousand kilometers or less in marginal seas of the NE Atlantic.},

However, this threat is often disregarded in conservation management and action because it is difﬁcult to quantify its effect. Increasing availability of high spatial-resolution satellite images may enable us to better incorporate this threat into future work, particularly in highly modiﬁed ecosystems such as the coastal zone. In this study we examine the potential of satellite night light imagery to predict the distribution of the endangered loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and green (Chelonia mydas) sea turtle nests in the eastern Mediterranean coastline. Using remote sensing tools and high resolution data derived from the SAC-C satellite and the International Space Station, we examined the relationship between the long term spatial patterns of sea turtle nests and the intensity of night lights along Israel’s entire Mediterranean coastline. We found that sea turtles nests are negatively related to night light intensity and are concentrated in darker sections along the coast. Our resulting GLMs showed that night lights were a signiﬁcant factor for explaining the distribution of sea turtle nests. Other signiﬁcant variables included: cliff presence, human population density and infrastructure. This study is one of the ﬁrst to show that night lights estimated with satellite-based imagery can be used to help explain sea turtle nesting activity at a detailed resolution over large areas. This approach can facilitate the management of species affected by night lights, and will be particularly useful in areas that are inaccessible or where broad-scale prioritization of conservation action is required.},

Here, we argue that this approach is not productive for ecological studies. Global meta-analyses of diverse species, regions and ecosystems have already given us ‘very high conﬁdence’ [sensu Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)] that ACC has impacted wild species in a general sense. Further, for well-studied species or systems, synthesis of experiments and models with long-term observations has given us similarly high conﬁdence that they have been impacted by regional climate change (regardless of its cause). However, the role of greenhouse gases in driving these impacts has not been estimated quantitatively. Should this be an ecological research priority? We argue that development of quantitative ecological models for this purpose faces several impediments, particularly the existence of strong, non-additive interactions among different external factors. However, even with current understanding of impacts of global warming, there are myriad climate change adaptation options already developed in the literature that could be, and in fact are being, implemented now.},

Here, we resurveyed a historical census of rocky shore fauna conducted in the 1940s and 1950s to assess whether there were latitudinal changes in distribution and abundance consistent with global climate change along Australia's east coast. This region has undergone rapid warming, with increases in temperature of {\textasciitilde}1.5 °C over the past 60 years. We also tested a historical hypothesis that a dramatic transition from tropical species to temperate species at 25°S represents a biogeographical boundary caused by environmental transitions in wave action and dispersal barriers. Twenty-two rocky shores were sampled between 23°S and 35°S, covering 1500 km of the coastline. A total of 80 species of macro-fauna were identiﬁed. Historical comparison of the 30 most common species revealed little change in species distribution with warming ocean temperature. We conclude that the environmental transition driven by wave exposure, local currents and the presence of large sand islands, and not temperature, is the primary factor inﬂuencing biogeographic distributions along the subtropical east coast of Australia.},

Models indicate that the most important information for phytoplankton functional type discrimination is spatio-temporal information and sea surface temperature.

We examine this suggestion for a number of areas in the North Sea and beyond in the Northeast Atlantic using coelenterate records from the Continuous Plankton Recorder and pH data from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea for the period 1946–2003. We could find no significant relationships between jellyfish abundance and acidic conditions in any of the regions investigated.

	abstract = {We investigated the growth rate and egg production of Calanus agulhensis, the dominant copepod on the western Agulhas Bank region of the southern Benguela upwelling system (South Africa), and assessed the implications for the spawning of sardine Sardinops sagax. Daily weight specific growth rate (SGR) of copepod developmental stages (N6 to female) was measured monthly between September and March 1993/94 and 1994/95. Seasonally, SGRs of small stages (N6 to C2) remained relatively constant. By contrast, SGRs of large stages (C3 to female) mirrored changes in chl a related to seasonal warming and wind patterns, with a moderate peak in September/October and a larger peak in January to March. Superimposed on this seasonal cycle were fluctuations in response to winds on the event scale. At the onset of upwelling, mean female SGR across the shelf was slow. During sustained upwelling, female SGR increased, with a peak associated with enhanced chl a in the upwelling front and slower rates inshore in newly upwelled water and offshore in oligotrophic water. Female SGR was fastest during prolonged quiescence when high chl a levels extended over most of the shelf. During downwelling, female SGRs decreased again, with fastest rates inshore. Overall, SGRs were not related to temperature, but were related to chl a, with stronger relationships for larger stages. This suggested food limitation of larger stages, which may be a consequence of their preference for larger phytoplankton cells that only occur at high concentrations in restricted locations in time and space in the southern Benguela upwelling system. The spawning of sardine varied seasonally and coincided with the maximum chl a concentration and production of C. agulhensis eggs (daily egg production × female density), both of which are a good source of food for fish larvae. Thus the timing of sardine spawning maximizes the food available to their larvae.},

	abstract = {Estimation of primary production over large areas of the ocean requires information on the shape of phytoplankton proﬁles. In this study we develop a generic quantitative approach to describe the continuous variation of proﬁle shape within a region. We illustrate this approach by application to the dynamic southern Benguela upwelling system. First, we describe proﬁle shape by ﬁtting a four-parameter shifted Gaussian model. We then use a model-building approach to relate each parameter to a suite of environmental variables that are either known for each point of the ocean in time and space (depth of the water column, season, and area) or are easily obtained from remote sensing (sea surface temperature and surface chlorophyll a). As these variables are highly correlated and non-linearly related to proﬁle shape, we use generalised additive models to visualise the non-linear relationships between each parameter and all environmental variables simultaneously. These relationships are then parameterised using generalised linear models to obtain a predictive equation for each proﬁle parameter. Relationships identiﬁed made intuitive sense in terms of the evolution of phytoplankton blooms in upwelling systems. We found strong predictive relationships for the depth of maximum chlorophyll (r 2 = 0.70) and the total chlorophyll in the peak (r2 = 0.74), the two most important parameters for estimating primary production. Predictive relationships were weaker for the width of the peak (r 2 = 0.21) and the background chlorophyll (r 2 = 0.15). The predictive equations identiﬁed can be applied on a pixel-by-pixel basis to concurrent sea surface temperature and ocean colour images to estimate proﬁle shape, and can be imbedded within local algorithms to provide regional primary production estimates. This approach can easily be applied to other biogeochemical provinces.},

Ocean acidiﬁcation as a result of the uptake of CO2 affects pteropods by increasing dissolution rates of their aragonite skeletons. Two species of pteropod found in Australian tropical waters were studied, Creseis acicula and Diacavolinia longirostris. To assess the changes in their aragonite shells, shell morphology, growth patterns, structure, size, and porosity are described for both species, from material collected at seven sites between the 1960s and the 2000s. Shell characteristics were used to explore variations over time potentially related to ocean acidiﬁcation. The aragonite saturation level (Varag) of surface waters was hindcast and a decline equivalent to 210\% (average of the seven sites) was found. Simultaneously, variations in shell thickness were recorded (C. acicula by 24.43 mm, D. longirostris by 25.37 mm) over the study period along with a signiﬁcant increase in shell porosity (C. acicula: +1.43\%, D. longirostris: +8.69\%). The work, although not conclusive, does suggest that pteropods off Northern Australia may have been inﬂuenced by the decline in Varag over the past few decades. Such adverse effects could ultimately affect thecosome survival and that of their predators.},

	abstract = {Information on the vertical chlorophyll structure in the ocean is important for estimating integrated chlorophyll a and primary production from satellite. For this study, vertical chlorophyll profiles from the Benguela upwelling system and the Angola-Benguela front were collected in winter to identify characteristic profiles. A shifted Gaussian model was fitted to each profile to estimate four parameters that defined the shape of the curve: the background chlorophyll concentration (B0), the height parameter of the peak (h), the width of the peak (σ) and the depth of the chlorophyll peak (zm). A type of artificial neural network called a self-organizing map (SOM) was then used on these four parameters to identify characteristic profiles. The analysis identified a continuum of chlorophyll patterns, from those with large surface peaks ({\textgreater}10 mg m -3) to those with smaller near-surface peaks ({\textless}2 mg m-3). The frequency of occurrence of each chlorophyll pattern identified by the SOM showed that the most frequent pattern ({\textasciitilde}12\%) had a near-surface peak and the least frequent pattern ({\textasciitilde}2\%) had a large surface peak. These characteristic profile shapes were then related to pertinent environmental variables such as sea surface temperature, surface chlorophyll, mixed layer depth and euphotic depth. Partitioning the SOM output map into environmental categories showed large peaks of surface chlorophyll dominating in water with cool temperature, high surface chlorophyll concentration and shallow mixed layer and euphotic depth. By contrast, smaller peaks of subsurface chlorophyll were in water with warmer temperature, lower surface chlorophyll concentration, intermediate mixed layer and deep euphotic depth. These relationships can be used semi-quantitatively to predict profile shape under different environmental conditions. The SOM analysis highlighted the large variability in shape of vertical chlorophyll profiles in the Benguela. This suggests that an ideal typical chlorophyll profile, as used in the framework of biogeochemical provinces, may not be applicable to this dynamic upwelling system.},

Here we outline the evolution of the CPR database through changes in technology, and how this has increased data access. Recent high-impact publications and the expanded role of CPR data in marine management demonstrate the usefulness of the dataset. We argue that solely supplying data to the research community is not sufficient in the current research climate; to promote wider use, additional tools need to be developed to provide visual representation and summary statistics. We outline 2 software visualisation tools, SAHFOS WinCPR and the digital CPR Atlas, which provide access to CPR data for both researchers and non-plankton specialists. We also describe future directions of the database, data policy and the development of visualisation tools. We believe that the approach at SAHFOS to increase data accessibility and provide new visualisation tools has enhanced awareness of the data and led to the financial security of the organisation; it also provides a good model of how long-term monitoring programmes can evolve to help secure their future.},

	abstract = {The analysis of apex predator diet has the ability to deliver valuable insights into ecosystem health, and the potential impacts a predator might have on commercially relevant species. The Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea) is an endemic apex predator and one of the world’s most endangered pinnipeds. Given that prey availability is vital to the survival of top predators, this study set out to understand what dietary information DNA metabarcoding could yield from 36 sea lion scats collected across 1,500 km of its distribution in southwest Western Australia. A combination of PCR assays were designed to target a variety of potential sea lion prey, including mammals, fish, crustaceans, cephalopods, and birds. Over 1.2 million metabarcodes identified six classes from three phyla, together representing over 80 taxa. The results confirm that the Australian sea lion is a wide-­ranging opportunistic predator that consumes an array of mainly demersal fauna. Further, the important commercial species Sepioteuthis australis (southern calamari squid) and Panulirus cygnus (western rock lobster) were detected, but were present in {\textless}25\% of samples. Some of the taxa identified, such as fish, sharks and rays, clarify previous knowledge of sea lion prey, and some, such as eel taxa and two gastropod species, represent new dietary insights. Even with modest sample sizes, a spatial analysis of taxa and operational taxonomic units found within the scat shows significant differences in diet between many of the sample locations and identifies the primary taxa that are driving this variance. This study provides new insights into the diet of this endangered predator and confirms the efficacy of DNA metabarcoding of scat as a noninvasive tool to more broadly define regional biodiversity.},

Here we describe projections of climate change in Australian waters and examine from the literature likely impacts of these changes on Australian marine biodiversity. For the Australian region, climate model simulations project oceanic warming, an increase in ocean stratiﬁcation and decrease in mixing depth, a strengthening of the East Australian Current, increased ocean acidiﬁcation, a rise in sea level, alterations in cloud cover and ozone levels altering the levels of solar radiation reaching the ocean surface, and altered storm and rainfall regimes. Evidence of climate change impacts on biological systems are generally scarce in Australia compared to the Northern Hemisphere. The poor observational records in Australia are attributed to a lack of studies of climate impacts on natural systems and species at regional or national scales. However, there are notable exceptions such as widespread bleaching of corals on the Great Barrier Reef and poleward shifts in temperate ﬁsh populations. Biological changes are likely to be considerable and to have economic and broad ecological consequences, especially in climate-change ‘hot spots’ such as the Tasman Sea and the Great Barrier Reef.},

	abstract = {A number of explanations have been advanced to account for the increased frequency and intensity at which jellyfish (pelagic cnidarians and ctenophores) blooms are being observed, most of which have been locally directed. Here, we investigate seasonal and inter-annual patterns in abundance and distribution of jellyfish in the North Atlantic Ocean to determine if there have been any system-wide changes over the period 1946–2005, by analysing records of the presence of coelenterates from the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey. Peaks in jellyfish abundance are strongly seasonal in both oceanic and shelf areas: oceanic populations have a mid-year peak that is more closely related to peaks in phyto- and zooplankton, whilst the later peak of shelf populations mirrors changes in SST and reflects processes of advection and aggregation. There have been large amplitude cycles in the abundance of oceanic and shelf jellyfish (although not synchronous) over the last 60 years, with a pronounced synchronous increase in abundance in both areas over the last 10 years. Inter-annual variations in jellyfish abundance in oceanic areas are related to zooplankton abundance and temperature changes, but not to the North Atlantic Oscillation or to a chlorophyll index. The long-term inter-annual abundance of jellyfish on the shelf could not be explained by any environmental variables investigated. As multi-decadal cycles and more recent increase in jellyfish were obvious in both oceanic and shelf areas, we conclude that these are likely to reflect an underlying climatic signal (and bottom-up control) rather than any change in fishing pressure (top-down control). Our results also highlight the role of the CPR data in investigating long-term changes in jellyfish, and suggest that the cnidarians sampled by the CPR are more likely to be holoplanktic hydrozoans and not the much larger meroplanktic scyphozoans as has been suggested previously.},

In the North Atlantic, semi-quantitative measurements of chlorophyll (Phytoplankton Color Index, PCI) for {\textgreater}50 years have been collected by the Continuous Plankton Recorder. Here we demonstrate a significant correlation between PCI and SeaWiFS Chl-a from 1997–2002. Combining both time series allows quantification of the stepwise increase in biomass in the mid-1980s; this regime shift corresponded to a 60\% increase in Chl-a. This was a result of an 80\% increase in Chl-a during winter, alongside a smaller summer increase. This new high-resolution data set on the monthly variation of Chl-a in the North Atlantic since 1948 is now available for the development and validation of climate models, and for interpretation of ecological changes related to climate.},

	abstract = {The North Sea is one of the most biologically productive ecosystems in the world and supports important fisheries. Climate-induced changes occurred in the pelagic ecosystems of the North Sea during the 1980s. These changes, which have been observed from phytoplankton to fish and among permanent (holoplankton) and temporary (meroplankton) plankton species, have resulted in alterations in plankton community composition and seasonality. Until now, the effects of climate-driven changes on biological linkages between pelagic and benthic ecosystems have not been examined. The present study indicates that changes in benthic organisms could have a profound effect on the trophodynamics of the pelagos. We demonstrate this by analyses of a long-term time series of North Sea plankton and sea surface temperature data. We discover that pronounced changes in the North Sea meroplankton, mainly related to an increased abundance and spatial distribution of the larvae of a benthic echinoderm, Echinocardium cordatum, result primarily from a stepwise increase in sea temperature after 1987 that has caused warmer conditions to occur earlier in the year than previously. Key stages of reproduction in E. cordatum, gametogenesis and spawning, appear to be influenced by winter and spring sea temperature and their larval development is affected by the quantity and quality of their phytoplankton food. Our analyses suggest that a new thermal regime in the North Sea in winter and spring may have benefited reproduction and survival in this benthic species. As a result, E. cordatum may be altering the trophodynamics of the summer pelagic ecosystem through competition between its larvae and holozooplankton taxa.},

	abstract = {Understanding how climate change will affect the planet is a key issue worldwide. Questions concerning the pace and impacts of climate change are thus central to many ecological and biogeochemical studies, and addressing the consequences of climate change is now high on the list of priorities for funding agencies. Here, we review the interactions between climate change and plankton communities, focusing on systematic changes in plankton community structure, abundance, distribution and phenology over recent decades. We examine the potential socioeconomic impacts of these plankton changes, such as the effects of bottom-up forcing on commercially exploited fish stocks (i.e. plankton as food for fish). We also consider the crucial roles that plankton might have in dictating the future pace of climate change via feedback mechanisms responding to elevated atmospheric CO2 levels. An important message emerges from this review: ongoing plankton monitoring programmes worldwide will act as sentinels to identify future changes in marine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Copepod growth rates were estimated from shipboard measurements of egg production of adult female Calanus agulhensis, Calanoides carinatus, Nannocalanus minor, and Centropages brachiatus and molting rates of juvenile stages (N6-C5) of C. agulhensis. Data were obtained during austral spring and summer of 1989-1995 in the southern Benguela upwelling system. While maximum growth rates showed less than a threefold decline over the body-size range examined (525-2,763-μm total length), probably owing to allometric considerations, mean growth rate decreased by one order of magnitude, suggesting limitation of growth rate by an environmental factor. Most of this decline in mean growth rate was attributable to food limitation of large copepods. Frequency distributions of growth rate under low food densities were severely skewed toward slow growth rate for large copepods, whereas they were more symmetric for smaller copepods. In contrast, at high food concentrations, the frequency distributions had a high degree of symmetry for all copepods. These frequency distributions were interpreted in terms of a probabilistic model describing the encounter rate of copepods with suitably sized food particles. The effect of food limitation on growth rate was evaluated by regressing the coefficient of variation of growth rate against body size. A strong positive relationship was found (r2 = 0.94, P \${\textless}\$ 0.001), indicating that small copepods were always growing well, whereas the growth rate of large copepods was more variable. It is suggested that this difference is a consequence of the ability of small copepods to consume small particles, which are present at a relatively constant background density.},

	shorttitle = {Plankton},
	abstract = {Healthy waterways and oceans are essential for our increasingly urbanised world. Yet monitoring water quality in aquatic environments is a challenge, as it varies from hour to hour due to stormwater and currents. Being at the base of the aquatic food web and present in huge numbers, plankton are strongly influenced by changes in environment and provide an indication of water quality integrated over days and weeks. Plankton are the aquatic version of a canary in a coal mine. They are also vital for our existence, providing not only food for fish, seabirds, seals and sharks, but producing oxygen, cycling nutrients, processing pollutants, and removing carbon dioxide from our atmosphere. This Second Edition of Plankton is a fully updated introduction to the biology, ecology and identification of plankton and their use in monitoring water quality. It includes expanded, illustrated descriptions of all major groups of freshwater, coastal and marine phytoplankton and zooplankton and a new chapter on teaching science using plankton. Best practice methods for plankton sampling and monitoring programs are presented using case studies, along with explanations of how to analyse and interpret sampling data.Plankton is an invaluable reference for teachers and students, environmental managers, ecologists, estuary and catchment management committees, and coastal engineers.},

We highlight how climate velocity has already been applied in conservation-related research, including climate residence time, climate refugia, endemism, historic and projected range shifts, exposure to climate change, and climate connectivity. Finally, we discuss ways to enhance the use of climate velocity in conservation through tailoring it to be more biologically meaningful, informing design of protected areas, conserving ocean biodiversity in 3D, and informing conservation actions.},
