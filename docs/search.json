By developing models of marine ecosystems based on differential equations and cutting-edge statistical approaches using high-performance computing, we aim to better understand key system drivers, conserve biodiversity, and ensure productive fisheries under climate change.\nThe Principal Investigator, Professor Anthony J. Richardson, is a 2018 highly cited researcher in Ecology. He has a joint research position between the School of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Queensland and CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere, Australia’s national science provider.\nThis website introduces our lab, its members, and summarises our activities. If you have a background in mathematics/statistics and want to apply your skills to real-world problems, of if you have a background in ecology and are interested in developing your quantitative skills, then this could be the lab for you.

    "text": "Conservation and protected areas\n\nHuman threats – including fishing, climate change, habitat destruction, pollution, and invasive species – are leading to declining abundance of many marine species. To mitigate impacts of these threats on biodiversity, marine protected areas – national parks in the ocean – are being created. As there is a global push to increase the marine protected area network coverage from 8% to potentially 20% or even 30% in the next decade, developing the science to underpin where to place these reserves is critical and timely.\nA current focus of our research is thus how to design robust climate-smart marine protected areas that conserve biodiversity, protect against climate change, retain biodiversity as the climate warms, ensure connectivity, minimise conflict with fishing, whilst considering the 3-D nature of the ocean. This is a tough task! It requires extensive computational expertise and infrastructure. Our work involves mapping global biodiversity and developing new approaches to the design of climate-smart marine protected area networks using state-of-the-art statistical and computational approaches on super-computers."

This requires long-term ocean observing problems. In partnership with the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and CSIRO (Australia’s national science provider), we are collecting and analysing data around Australia on plankton – the lower trophic levels in the ocean that ultimately support fish, marine mammals, marine reptiles and seabirds. We use modern, flexible, robust statistical techniques such as generalised linear and additive mixed models and multivariate approaches to analyse these datasets and make data products such as maps and ecosystem indicators. These indicators of ecosystem change inform marine assessments of the state and trends of the ocean ecosystems.\nTo find out more about our plankton monitoring work see:\nAustralian Plankton Survey website.\nThe Plankton Factsheet.\nThe State and Trends of Australia’s Oceans Report.\nThe IMOS Image gallery."

    "text": "Quarto ‘quick and dirty’ or {Golem} for longevity and complexity?\nAs expected in an open-source programming language, the app-making landscape in R seems to be in constant flux. Something newish that I’ve been finding useful lately is using Quarto’s ‘Dashboards with Shiny for R’ feature.\nQuarto is very similar to Rmarkdown, but has a few additional features. One of them is the ability to embed R {shiny} apps. So you end up writing your app like you would a markdown doc - the context, ui, and server are all code chunks, and the text around those code chunks set’s up the UI. For example, normally in markdown we use # to delineate and navigate headers; in Quarto Shiny Dashboards, # are used to delineate pages, tab panels, etc.\nI’ve found it’s great for proto-typing simple apps - you can get something up and running very quickly in Quarto’s ‘Dashboards with Shiny for R’. However, I think it could get unwieldy when you start building complex apps with modules etc. In that case, developing your {shiny} app as an R package with {golem} might be a better option. {golem} provides a great framework for engineering production grade shiny apps that are complex and can be easily maintained in the long-term.\nI ended up turning the prototype app I built in Quarto’s ‘Dashboards with Shiny for R’ into an R package with {golem}. It took much longer than I expected, but much of that time was learning about R package development (which I had never done before) and {golem}.\nIn the end I think it was worth the extra time and effort streamline as an R package. But if you want to compare for yourself, find the protoype Quarto dashboard shiny here and the {golem} R package version here.\nCurious to hear others’ experiences though - please get in touch."

With the rise of the internet, having a personal website has become more critical than ever. A personal website serves as a platform to showcase your research work, achievements, and credentials to a global audience. It’s a professional tool that helps you stand out in a crowded digital world and reach a wider audience. In this tutorial, we will be exploring the steps involved in creating a personal website that accurately reflects your identity. From choosing the right tools all the way to publishing your website on the internet, this post will cover everything you need to know to create a successful and effective personal website. Whether you’re a seasoned researcher or just starting out, this guide is designed to help you achieve your online goals and reach a new level of discoverability.\nThe internet is full of tools to build a website, and their sheer amount can be overwhelming. WordPress is a great no-code tool, but its visual editor has driven me nuts when I used it in the past to do client work as a freelance web designer. I personally prefer code-based tools because they give me full control and reproducibility. But even within the realm of code-based web design, there are more tools than a single person could ever try out. In this blog post, we will talk about how to set up your personal website with Quarto."

Fill in your details, such as your name (title field), a brief description, and a global image of yourself.\n\n\n2.4.2 Navigation\nThe navigation in the template is split in two parts. The left side contains icons for your social links, such as Twitter, GitHub, or email.\nThe right side links to other pages of your website. Each navigation entry consists of a title (text), followed by a link (href). Take a look at the example entries and continue the pattern as you see fit.\n\n\n2.4.3 Advanced settings\nThe rest of the _quarto.yml file just controls that we will indeed create a website, our preview tab doesn’t change all the time, and we can publish our website without complications. Don’t mess with this part unless you know what you are doing. If you do know what you are doing: Move fast and break things 😉\n\n\n2.4.4 More config tweaks\nThis blog post covers the fundamentals to set you up with a working website. Are you hungry for more and want to pull an all-nighter because creating a website can be super addictive? The official Quarto Documentation contains a bunch of other settings you can tweak via the _quarto.yml configuration. Happy hacking.

The template is called jolla, and you can find other options here. The id field assigns a name to the “About” section such that you can insert it anywhere in your page. As the name might suggest, the image field contains the path of an image to display on your landing page. Finally, the links field contains a bunch of social links. Each social entry consists of three fields:\n\nicon: identifier of an icon, such as twitter or envelope. You can take a look at the Standard Bootstrap5 Icons for more icon names.\ntext: description of the entry, usually for accessibility\nhref: link, make sure to add mailto: before an email address\n\nAs you can see in the /index.qmd file, the “About” block is inserted in the actual document via\n\n\n/index.qmd\n\n::: {#about-block}\n:::\n\nand you can add a nice introduction about yourself below the block."

    "text": "3.1 Preparing your website for GitHub pages\nThe template already contains all necessary settings for GitHub pages, so you don’t have to do anything in this section. However, it’s always good to have a superficial understanding of how things work, and it’s fairly straightforward in this case. We use the simplest form of GitHub pages: We build the entire website locally (i.e., in RStudio) and output the built page into the docs/ folder. This is configured in the output-dir field of the almighty _quarto.yml:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs\n\nWe commit the &lt;github username&gt;.github.io to Github, which includes the docs/ folder, and GitHub pages simply uses that folder to serve our website. This has one important consequence: If we make any change to our website, we have to Render the website again in RStudio. That’s how the updates make it to the docs/ folder! Only changing the .qmd file is not enough because GitHub does not render our site directly from the .qmd source.\nNote to advanced readers: You can set up a GitHub action to let GitHub build the website directly from the source files. But that deserves its own tutorial since some bugs persist which make things awkward (as of February 2023). If you would like to see automatic deployment covered in a future blog post, please let me know!\nThe second change to our website files is to include an empty file with the name .nojekyll (already included in the template). Usually, GitHub pages does some post-processing on your website files with Jekyll. Since Quarto handles all the processing we need, we want to deactivate Jekyll’s post-processing. Adding a .nojekyll file to your website root directory does exactly that: It bypasses post-processing via Jekyll."

    "text": "5.1 General web development tips\nHere are some general web development tips, ranging from file management and DNS over to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\n5.1.1 Relative links\nSuppose you are editing the file projects/index.qmd and want to add a link to the page &lt;github username&gt;.github.io/photography. You can of course link to the full URL &lt;github username&gt;.github.io/photography, but that link will break if you change your domain name to www.&lt;name&gt;.com. Instead, you can use relative links. You only need to know that ../ takes you one layer back on the folder tree.\nExample: Starting from projects/index.qmd, you can use ../photography/index.qmd to walk back one layer into the root folder of your website, and then move into the folder photography/, where index.qmd of photography lives. This relative path is valid no matter what domain you use. It only breaks if you decide to remodel the entire structure of your website. But in this case, I assume you know what you are doing and you’re well off on your own 😉\n\n\n5.1.2 CSS flavors\nQuarto supports some cool CSS variants, such as SCSS. In SCSS, you can add variables such as $orange to define your favorite color once and use it in many different places. This deserves a separate blog post, though.\n\n\n5.1.3 Include Order\nIf you mix HTML with CSS and JavaScript, make sure to include the files in the correct order. If your JavaScript manipulates existing HTML objects through the DOM, make sure to include the JavaScript file after the HTML body. If you include the JavaScript before the HTML body, JavaScript will not know that the HTML objects exist, and you will have a bad time. Been there, spent well over 2 hours debugging. 0/10, cannot recommend.\n\n\n5.1.4 Add favicon"

    "text": "Senior Research Fellows\n\nDr Jason Everett\n\nI am a biological oceanographer, with an interest in how oceanographic processes structure planktonic ecosystems.\nMy research has focused on how flow regimes, boundary currents, eddies and upwelling events drive changes in the biomass, species distribution and size structure of zooplankton communities. In addition, I have extensive experience working with satellite data and numerical model output.\nMy current research focus is to quantify how the size, abundance and biomass of zooplankton and fish change across local, regional and global scales. By quantifying the size-based ecosystem through modelling and observations, we can better understand processes such as metabolism, predation or movement, which constrain the role of an individual in its food web. In particular, the biomass and size distribution of zooplankton is poorly understood relative to phytoplankton and fish in our oceans, yet it is critical to understanding the efficiency of energy transfer through to fisheries."
