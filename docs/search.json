In addition, he have extensive experience working with satellite data and numerical model output.\nJason’s current research focus is to quantify how the size, abundance and biomass of zooplankton and fish change across local, regional and global scales. By quantifying the size-based ecosystem through modelling and observations, we can better understand processes such as metabolism, predation or movement, which constrain the role of an individual in its food web. In particular, the biomass and size distribution of zooplankton is poorly understood relative to phytoplankton and fish in our oceans, yet it is critical to understanding the efficiency of energy transfer through to fisheries."

    "text": "PhD Students\n\nSharad Bayyana\n\n\n\n\nSharad is a marine biologist who has joined the School of Environment as a PhD candidate. He comes from India, where he was engaged in several marine and wildlife research projects, after completing his master’s in marine biology. He also holds a post-graduate diploma in Remote Sensing and GIS. Back in India, he conducted research at the Wildlife Institute of India, in understanding the spatial ecology of Dugongs, mangroves succession in the Nicobar group of islands after the tsunami of 2004, and coral reef biodiversity assessment of Malvan Marine Sanctuary, along the west coast of India. He has previously worked at the Horniman Museum, London as a visiting researcher, to conduct research on coral reproductive biology and restoration practices. Lately, at Wildlife Conservation Society-India, he was involved in developing data-driven strategies for management practices of Marine Protected Areas along the west coast of India, before moving to Brisbane. For his PhD, he will pursue the implications of climate-driven risks on the biodiversity dynamics under the project “Portfolio projection of biodiversity responses under climate change”. The project aims to quantify adaptive and migration responses as vulnerability metrics, providing resource managers with novel tools to formulate flexible management strategies.\n\n\n\n\nDiego Bezerra\n\n\n\n\nDiego is an interdisciplinary marine ecologist interested in understanding the ecological mechanisms that drive ecosystem health. He foremost focuses on delivering scientific information to improve marine protected areas’ conservation outcomes. He is currently investigating elasmobranch migratory connectivity across reefs, and multispecies network models in conservation planning. He is also researching elasmobranch movement using network analysis as a tool to estimate population structures. Finally, his project aims to provide a baseline for shark migratory movement in Australia, strengthening understanding of connectivity within and beyond national jurisdictions.\n\n\n\n\nKristine (Tin) Buenafe\n\n\n\n\nKristine, better known as Tin, is a quantitative marine ecologist from the Philippines. Although most of her colleagues in her undergraduate degree chose to go into medicine, she took the road less travelled — a path in research… and while most of her colleagues in marine science studied coastal ecosystems, she was more interested in the high seas. Tin has a Master’s degree in Tropical Biodiversity and Ecosystems (TROPIMUNDO), an Eramus Mundus Joint Master’s Degree program, where she finished first in her batch (Plus Grande Distinction). Tin has developed methods used by conservation practitioners to transition to more climate-smart spatial planning approaches. She’s done this by prioritising protection on climate refugia. In her PhD research, Tin wishes to continue her work on climate change and spatial planning by taking it a step further and developing ways of designing more connected, climate-smart protected area networks.\n\n\n\n\nEmer Cunningham\n\n\n\n\nEmer is a marine ecology student and researcher, who lives and works in her hometown of Magandjin (Brisbane). Emer acknowledges that this ‘home’ is unceded, sovereign Aboriginal Country, and is committed to learning more about the lands and waters that she cares about so deeply. Back in 2018, Emer started a Bachelor of Advanced Science (Honours) at the University of Queensland – and she’s never left. Emer is in the final year of her PhD, investigating the patterns and drivers of ‘novel’ ecological states within coral reef ecosystems and pelagic plankton communities. Currently, Emer is working in the MME Lab researching ‘novelty’ in our changing climate – and helping to integrate this concept of rapid, unprecedented environmental change into marine spatial planning.\n\n\n\n\nAlvise Dabala\n\n\n\n\nAlvise is a PhD student at the Mathematical Marine Ecology Lab and the Applied Marine Biogeography Lab, supervised by Prof. Anthony Richardson and A/Prof. Daniel Dunn. His research focuses on developing climate-smart and connected spatial prioritisations for mangrove conservation to protect mangrove biodiversity and ecosystem services. He holds an Erasmus Mundus Master’s degree in tropical ecology (TROPIMUNDO). During his thesis, he developed a global study which identifies priority areas for mangrove conservation that maximise ecosystem services. Before starting his PhD at The University of Queensland, he joined the iAtlantic project, funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, developing spatial prioritisations for the conservation of the Atlantic Ocean at the University of Azores.\n\n\n\n\nAharon Fleury\n\n\n\n\nAharon Fleury completed his Master of Science Biology (Fisheries) program at University of Victoria, Canada in 2016 where he evaluated the reproductive ecology of hagfish off the coast of Vancouver Island. He has since worked five years as an environmental consultant performing ecological and human health risk assessments and modelling the movement of contaminants to humans, plants, and animals via biotic transport pathways. The aim of Aharon’s PhD research is to develop and apply a framework, built on an individual-based model, for environmental impact assessments of marine species that explicitly incorporates connectivity across a migratory cycle and facilitates decision-making by incorporating stakeholder values.\n\n\n\n\nYunzhe Liu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHannah Moloney\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJaime Restrepo\n\n\n\n\nJaime (read: Hi-Meh [Hispanic name]) is a Colombian researcher and conservationist, with a background in environmental sciences. He has a master’s degree from the International Institute for Conservation and Wildlife Management from the University of Costa Rica. Jaime has more than a decade of experience working on the field and studying some of the most important populations of marine turtles globally, monitoring major rookeries for leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea), hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) and green turtle (Chelonia mydas). Jaime has also been involved in conservation programs to protect the recovering population of jaguars (Panthera onca) at Tortuguero National Park, in Costa Rica. Currently, Jaime is an active member of the International Sea Turtle Society; as such, he has taken part on several symposia both presenting his research outcomes and coordinating regional meetings, he is now a PhD candidate at the University of Queensland, studying migratory connectivity for the two largest nesting populations of green turtles globally, implementing satellite telemetry monitoring combined with stable isotopes analysis to identify important foraging areas supporting these important populations.\nSome of his previous work can be found here."

    "text": "Dynamic ecosystem modelling\n\nTo manage marine biodiversity and fisheries sustainably in a changing climate, we need powerful tools to forecast how ecosystems will respond. Our lab develops dynamic ecosystem models that simulate life in the ocean—from bacteria to whales—based on core biological processes like feeding, growth, and predation. Central to our approach are size spectrum models, which track energy flow and carbon cycling across all body sizes and trophic levels.\nA major innovation in our work is resolving zooplankton, the critical but often overlooked link between phytoplankton and fish. Zooplankton not only sustain food webs but also drive the biological carbon pump—a process that draws carbon from the atmosphere and stores it in the deep sea. Yet most models simplify or omit their role.\nWe are advancing ZooMSS (Zooplankton Model of Size Spectra), a global, process-based model designed to better represent zooplankton diversity, temperature sensitivity, and carbon dynamics. By refining how zooplankton are modelled—including their impact on fisheries and carbon sequestration—we aim to answer key questions:\n\nHow will climate change alter zooplankton communities and their role in ocean carbon storage?\nHow does the temperature sensitivity of different zooplankton groups and processes alter carbon cycling in the ocean?\nWhy are there so many tuna in nutrient-poor tropical waters?\nWhat can improved zooplankton modelling tell us about future fish stocks and climate mitigation?\n\nZooMSS is an ecosystem model based on partial differential equations, is run on a supercomputer, and is the only global fisheries-ecosystem model that focuses on better representing zooplankton feeding relationships."

    "text": "Ecosystem Change\n\nTo manage our oceans – and our impacts upon them – we need robust indicators of the state of marine ecosystems over time. This requires long-term ocean observing problems. In partnership with the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and CSIRO (Australia’s national science provider), we are collecting and analysing data around Australia on plankton – the lower trophic levels in the ocean that ultimately support fish, marine mammals, marine reptiles and seabirds. We use modern, flexible, robust statistical techniques such as generalised linear and additive mixed models and multivariate approaches to analyse these datasets and make data products such as maps and ecosystem indicators. These indicators of ecosystem change inform marine assessments of the state and trends of the ocean ecosystems.\nTo find out more about our plankton monitoring work see:\nAustralian Plankton Survey website.\nThe Plankton Factsheet.\nThe State and Trends of Australia’s Oceans Report.\nThe IMOS Image gallery."

With the rise of the internet, having a personal website has become more critical than ever. A personal website serves as a platform to showcase your research work, achievements, and credentials to a global audience. It’s a professional tool that helps you stand out in a crowded digital world and reach a wider audience. In this tutorial, we will be exploring the steps involved in creating a personal website that accurately reflects your identity. From choosing the right tools all the way to publishing your website on the internet, this post will cover everything you need to know to create a successful and effective personal website. Whether you’re a seasoned researcher or just starting out, this guide is designed to help you achieve your online goals and reach a new level of discoverability.\nThe internet is full of tools to build a website, and their sheer amount can be overwhelming. WordPress is a great no-code tool, but its visual editor has driven me nuts when I used it in the past to do client work as a freelance web designer. I personally prefer code-based tools because they give me full control and reproducibility. But even within the realm of code-based web design, there are more tools than a single person could ever try out.

Fill in your details, such as your name (title field), a brief description, and a global image of yourself.\n\n\n2.4.2 Navigation\nThe navigation in the template is split in two parts. The left side contains icons for your social links, such as Twitter, GitHub, or email.\nThe right side links to other pages of your website. Each navigation entry consists of a title (text), followed by a link (href). Take a look at the example entries and continue the pattern as you see fit.\n\n\n2.4.3 Advanced settings\nThe rest of the _quarto.yml file just controls that we will indeed create a website, our preview tab doesn’t change all the time, and we can publish our website without complications. Don’t mess with this part unless you know what you are doing. If you do know what you are doing: Move fast and break things 😉\n\n\n2.4.4 More config tweaks\nThis blog post covers the fundamentals to set you up with a working website. Are you hungry for more and want to pull an all-nighter because creating a website can be super addictive? The official Quarto Documentation contains a bunch of other settings you can tweak via the _quarto.yml configuration. Happy hacking.

Instead, you should go with /mypage/index.qmd and get the modern-looking URL www.yourname.com/mypage.\n!Avoid .html in your URL by using a subfolder with index.html.\nOnce you have created your brand-new index.qmd, just copy the code skeleton of any other index.qmd from the template and start adding your content.

However, it’s always good to have a superficial understanding of how things work, and it’s fairly straightforward in this case. We use the simplest form of GitHub pages: We build the entire website locally (i.e., in RStudio) and output the built page into the docs/ folder. This is configured in the output-dir field of the almighty _quarto.yml:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs\n\nWe commit the &lt;github username&gt;.github.io to Github, which includes the docs/ folder, and GitHub pages simply uses that folder to serve our website. This has one important consequence: If we make any change to our website, we have to Render the website again in RStudio. That’s how the updates make it to the docs/ folder! Only changing the .qmd file is not enough because GitHub does not render our site directly from the .qmd source.\nNote to advanced readers: You can set up a GitHub action to let GitHub build the website directly from the source files. But that deserves its own tutorial since some bugs persist which make things awkward (as of February 2023). If you would like to see automatic deployment covered in a future blog post, please let me know!\nThe second change to our website files is to include an empty file with the name .nojekyll (already included in the template). Usually, GitHub pages does some post-processing on your website files with Jekyll. Since Quarto handles all the processing we need, we want to deactivate Jekyll’s post-processing. Adding a .nojekyll file to your website root directory does exactly that: It bypasses post-processing via Jekyll."

You can of course link to the full URL &lt;github username&gt;.github.io/photography, but that link will break if you change your domain name to www.&lt;name&gt;.com. Instead, you can use relative links. You only need to know that ../ takes you one layer back on the folder tree.\nExample: Starting from projects/index.qmd, you can use ../photography/index.qmd to walk back one layer into the root folder of your website, and then move into the folder photography/, where index.qmd of photography lives. This relative path is valid no matter what domain you use. It only breaks if you decide to remodel the entire structure of your website. But in this case, I assume you know what you are doing and you’re well off on your own 😉\n\n\n5.1.2 CSS flavors\nQuarto supports some cool CSS variants, such as SCSS. In SCSS, you can add variables such as $orange to define your favorite color once and use it in many different places. This deserves a separate blog post, though.\n\n\n5.1.3 Include Order\nIf you mix HTML with CSS and JavaScript, make sure to include the files in the correct order. If your JavaScript manipulates existing HTML objects through the DOM, make sure to include the JavaScript file after the HTML body. If you include the JavaScript before the HTML body, JavaScript will not know that the HTML objects exist, and you will have a bad time. Been there, spent well over 2 hours debugging. 0/10, cannot recommend.\n\n\n5.1.4 Add favicon"

Despite their ecological significance, most lie in the high seas, where protection is limited. The recently adopted Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Treaty provides a historic opportunity to advance conservation in these regions, but actionable science is urgently needed to guide spatial planning. This PhD project will explore how the connectivity of biodiversity among seamounts—driven by deep ocean currents —can inform the design of protected area networks. While direct observations of population connectivity in the deep sea are challenging, high-resolution oceanographic models offer new opportunities to simulate larval dispersal among seamounts. The student will simulate three-dimensional dispersal of neutrally buoyant particles from selected seamounts in key regions such as the western Pacific and central Pacific. These simulations will explore horizontal and vertical connectivity, identify potential source and sink regions, assess how oceanographic isolation may drive endemism, assess model predictions against available genetic data, and explore how oceanographic connectivity may support resilient fisheries. A key focus will be designing protected area networks that incorporate seamount connectivity. This PhD is suited to a student with interests in ocean modelling, marine conservation, and spatial ecology. It will involve working with large oceanographic datasets and particle tracking simulations, and will include collaborations with deep-sea ecologists, geneticists, and policy experts. The student will gain valuable skills in oceanographic modelling, systematic conservation planning, and deep-sea ecology, contributing directly to science-policy initiatives under the BBNJ Treaty."

The student will leverage several global resources - including the BIOTIMEv2 database, IUCN red list status and AquaX distribution maps - and use Generalised Linear Mixed Models to assess how trends in species differ: inside and outside MPAs; with levels of protection in MPAs; with time since MPA designation; across taxonomic groups; with human stressors; with climate exposure; and across ecological traits. Are biodiversity trends more positive in highly protected areas or where more of a species range is covered by MPAs? Do MPAs buffer against climate change impacts such as ocean warming? Are larger species more vulnerable than small ones, and are certain habitats more affected than others? This project offers an exciting opportunity for a student with strong quantitative skills to work at the science-policy interface of marine conservation.

    "text": "Smart zoning for a sustainable ocean: Optimising protected areas for biodiversity and fisheries\nAlthough conservation scientists and NGOs advocate for fully protected no-take Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), most MPAs end up as partial-take zones that permit some fishing—often without a clear strategy to maximise biodiversity outcomes. As global efforts accelerate to meet the 30x30 target—protecting 30% of the ocean by 2030—this disconnect between conservation ideals and real-world implementation risks delivering suboptimal outcomes for both nature and people. This PhD project asks: how can we better zone the global ocean to conserve biodiversity while supporting sustainable fisheries? It will explore whether zoning for one type of fishing (e.g., pelagic) can help protect other biodiversity components (e.g., benthic habitats), and whether more realistic, explicitly multi-use planning can outperform traditional no-take-only approaches. The project includes three integrated components: (1) a global synthesis of bycatch data across fishing gears to identify biodiversity most at risk; (2) an assessment of fishing activity within existing MPAs and its biodiversity impacts; and (3) a spatial optimisation analysis to design multi-use ocean zones that maximise both conservation and fisheries benefits. This is an excellent opportunity for a student interested in marine spatial planning, conservation science, and applied ecological modelling. The work will involve global datasets, advanced geospatial and statistical tools, and contribute directly to international policy efforts under the Convention on Biological Diversity.

This project will tackle this gap by assessing how well existing MPAs conserve environmental heterogeneity for marine species, inspired by cutting-edge approaches recently applied to terrestrial ecosystems (e.g., Hanson et al. 2020, Nature). Using climate model outputs (Earth System Models) and species distribution data from AquaX, the student will classify key environmental features, including temperature, and evaluate how well marine protected areas meet conservation targets across these gradients.

This project asks a pressing question: in a warming ocean, will zooplankton reduce their daytime descents to the safety of deeper waters to feed for longer in surface waters and thus be more at risk of predation by visual predators such as fish? The outcomes have major implications for marine predator-prey dynamics and the biological carbon pump. Climate models and observations increasingly suggest that primary production from phytoplankton will decline, challenging zooplankton to find sufficient food while coping with the higher metabolic demands of warmer waters. By analysing long-term (&gt;60 yrs) global zooplankton datasets, this project will investigate if copepods are already altering their migration patterns, drawing parallels with other climate-driven behavioural changes in the animal kingdom—such as increased diurnal ibex foraging at night to escape heat, despite increased risk. The successful candidate will gain skills in big data analysis, ecological modelling, and climate-ecosystem interactions, contributing to a frontier area of marine science with wide-reaching ecological and biogeochemical consequences."

He has recently finished an Erasmus Mundus Joint Master’s Degree in Tropical Biodiversity and Ecosystems (TROPIMUNDO), where he graduated as the top student of his cohort and received the Best Student Award. For his masters, he has studied in different institutions across different countries in Europe: Université Libre de Bruxelles/Vrije Universiteit Brussel (Semester 1); Université de La Réunion (Semester 2); and Università degli Studi di Firenze (Semester 3). For his final semester, which is completely allocated to thesis work, he worked on a marine spatial planning project using quantitative tools with The University of Queensland."

    "text": "Tracking climate change using plankton\n\nPlankton are sentinels of climate change. Phytoplankton produce half the oxygen on Earth and support marine food webs, while zooplankton transfer carbon to fish, whales, and seabirds, and drive key biogeochemical cycles. But in a rapidly changing climate, how are these critical organisms responding?\nOur lab uses decades of high-resolution plankton data from the Australian Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) run by CSIRO, historical records, and global data sets to uncover how climate variability and change—including marine heatwaves, El Niño, warming, and acidification—is reshaping plankton abundance, distribution, species composition, and behaviour.\nWe apply cutting-edge statistical modelling (e.g., GLMMs, GAMMs, time-series analysis) to investigate:\n\nShifts in plankton distribution, abundance, timing and community structure\nZooplankton responses to warming and acidification\nEmerging trends in gelatinous zooplankton (jellyfish and salps) in response to global change\nChanges in zooplankton diel vertical migration in response to cliamte change, with implications for predator-prey interactions and the biological carbon pump\nEcosystem health indicators and assess trends over time to inform marine assessments and national reporting.\n\nLearn more: 👉 Australian Plankton Survey 👉 Plankton Factsheet 👉 State of Australia’s Oceans 👉 Zooplankton Image Gallery"
