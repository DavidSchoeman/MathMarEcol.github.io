<h2 data-number="1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-good-scientific-writing"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> What is good scientific writing?</h2>
<p>Maybe a truthful but uninformative answer is “You know when you read it!”. Being able to understand the message easily is clearly essential. But so is being concise, as words cost journals money and scientists have limited time to read your work. But good scientific writing is more than just being clear and concise. For example, newspaper articles can be clear and concise, but most would say that the journalistic style is inappropriate in a scientific setting. Scientific writing has a host of conventions, not all of which are always made explicit. For example, adhering to the typical structure of a scientific paper, not using colloquialisms, not providing opinion, and not being emotive, to name a few. Although it might feel that such “rules” take the fun out of writing, good scientific writing should not be bland and boring to read. There is room, and indeed a need, for creativity.</p>

<section id="why-write-well" class="level2" data-number="1.2">
<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-write-well"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Why write well?</h2>
<p>There are many reasons why as scientists we need to write well. First, science is about ideas, and we need to communicate those ideas clearly, effectively and interestingly. An engaged reader will remember what s/he has read. If you fail to communicate effectively, your work will ultimately be of little use to the wider scientific community, resulting in lower uptake and fewer citations.</p>
<p>Second, publishing is the currency of science and requires convincing Editors and Reviewers that your work is robust and meaningful. If your work is not well written, you cannot expect others to understand it. Reviewers can become bogged down in poor writing and sometimes assume that it is indicative of poor science. Reviewers sometimes return poorly written manuscripts directly to the Editor and refuse to review it. At best poor scientific writing leads to delays in the publication process, and at worst outright rejection.</p>
<p>Third, writing clearly will improve your science. If your supervisors, co-authors, and collaborators understand your message and see that you have worked hard to provide a clearly written piece of work, they will provide far better input. If collaborators have to rewrite your work to understand it before they can comment on the content, you will frustrate them immensely and you will receive fewer quality comments about scientific direction and whether your paper hits the mark. In fact, writing well is valued by many collaborators and will lead to more collaborations.</p>
<p>Last, writing well is a fundamental scientific skill (along with, for example, knowledge of the scientific method, quantitative skills, and discipline-specific technical skills), and we have a responsibility to write as well as we can out of respect for others, and to pass this knowledge on. With escalating pressures on academics, fewer of them are taking the time to help students with their writing skills. In the worst cases, supervisors and collaborators to pass on the task of language editing to the peer-review process. This is hugely counterproductive, and simply reinforces the cycle of deterioration in writing skills. Students and the academics who supervise them need to take responsibility in being part of the solution – improving scientific writing by passing on their knowledge to others.</p>

<section id="why-do-we-have-difficulties-writing-well" class="level2" data-number="1.3">
<h2 data-number="1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-do-we-have-difficulties-writing-well"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Why do we have difficulties writing well?</h2>
<p>We all have to learn scientific writing – scientific English is no one’s first language! And it is even more difficult if English is not your mother tongue, especially for people who speak languages from outside Europe. So scientific writing does not come easily and requires hard work.</p>
<p>Throughout our studies, we are not taught the concepts that are necessary for good writing. In many countries, the teaching of grammar at school is out of vogue. Scientific writing is also often not taught at university at the undergraduate levels. Nowadays, writing well is not a major learning outcome of most science courses, and assignments are marked predominantly on content and not readability and style. It is also easier to learn scientific writing during your postgraduate study when you can draw on your research, but many countries do not have coursework during postgraduate studies. Unfortunately, during this key developmental period, many supervisors often feel too busy to spend time to improve the writing of their students.</p>
<p>Writing well also takes considerable time and effort. Writing well requires hard work rewriting many drafts, being self-critical of your own work, being afraid to make sometimes substantial changes, and opening up yourself to critique and potential criticism from others. For all these reasons, many scientists have trouble writing well. But scientific writing can be learned.</p>

<section id="how-this-e-book-can-help" class="level2" data-number="1.4">
<h2 data-number="1.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-this-e-book-can-help"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> How this e-book can help</h2>
<p>This e-book, <em>How to write well</em>, provides what we think is best practice in terms of scientific writing and simple approaches to avoid common pitfalls. Often errors in writing are corrected or stylistic suggestions made by supervisors,</p>
<p>reviewers or peers, without an explanation, primarily because of the people are time poor. This book is a result of seeing common mistakes by our students, and wanting to teach them how they can improve their writing. During our careers we have developed inherent knowledge about good scientific writing, and this e- book is an attempt to write this down into a coherent whole that is useful to others.</p>
<p>Our approach is to identify a common problem, explain why it is a problem, illustrate it with examples, and show solutions. The content here is based on our experience, is by no means exhaustive, and others might have a different opinion. We are not English teachers or grammar Nazis (although Dave might be…?). We are merely practicing scientists interested in improving our own and others’ writing by sharing our experiences.</p>
<p>Finally, this is part of a series of e-books that can help guide you through your scientific career. Often the best way to learn much of this information is to seek out a mentor. But it can be difficult to find a mentor with the insight, all-round skills, and the time available to provide advice. We have written this series of e- books to provide you with such a mentor – hopefully to provide the knowledge and guidance that you need in your career.</p>
<p>This is the first e-book in the series. The second e-book is <em>Writing a scientific paper</em>. Early on in our careers we are ill-prepared for this challenge. Experienced scientists generally acquire the skills slowly and haphazardly through osmosis or from trial-and-error. Writing a paper thus often seems like a “dark art” – one that some scientists have mastered, but one that is hidden and rarely shared. The e- book <em>Writing a scientific paper</em> shines a light on the process of writing a scientific paper and helps you master it.</p>
<p>The third e-book is <em>Navigating the peer-review process</em>. This often-overlooked part of the publication process involves understanding what different journals expect, what Editors and Reviewers look for, and how the peer-review process works. The e-book <em>Navigating the peer-review process</em> formalises our knowledge, experiences and opinions over the past 25 years of how we have gotten our work published. This e-book should will boost your chances of getting your work published, make it easier to get it published, reduce the time it takes to get it published, and help you formalise your own best practice.</p>
<p>You can read these e-books in any order, and you can read their chapters in any order, dipping into the chapters most relevant to you. These books are targeted at early- and mid-career researchers, but will also provide insights for more experienced scientists. We would appreciate your feedback about what you found useful (or not) in the e-books, and what you would like to see covered in the future.</p>

<p>You should try and state the facts without using emotive terms include <em>alarming</em>, <em>concerning</em>, <em>drastic</em>, <em>lovely</em>, <em>useless</em>, <em>wonderful</em> and <em>worringly</em>. Especially in research focusing on conservation of habitats or iconic species, it is easy to use emotive language. If in doubt, think of the animal as a cockroach and see whether you would use the same language!</p>

<h2 data-number="2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="be-consistent"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Be consistent</h2>
<p>Reviewers and examiners often regard sloppiness and lack of attention in scientific writing as an indication of carelessness in your science. Some common examples include: - Use capitals for proper nouns everywhere - Whether you choose to use <em>–ize</em> or <em>–ise</em>, be consistent - Whether you choose to use a space (preferably) or not between numbers and their units, be consistent</p>

<p>There are a bunch of things that are wrong and are just sloppy. Below are some examples, none of which is that important, but show a lack of care that can make the reader question how careful your science is.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> La Nina/El Nino</p>
<p><strong>It is:</strong> La Niña/El Niño</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> <em>Homo spp.</em></p>
<p><strong>It is:</strong> <em>Homo</em> spp. (Only the genus names is italicised).</p>
<p>**** Rather than: m2</p>
<p><strong>It is:</strong> m2</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> <a href="http://www.lternet.edu/">www.lternet.edu</a></p>

<h2 data-number="2.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="repetition-is-good"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Repetition is good!</h2>
<p>Scientific writing is different from writing novels. For example, in a novel an author might use different terms to identify the same thing to make it more interesting. However, in a scientific paper, repetition of the same term in makes it easier for the Reader to follow.</p>

<section id="elegant-variation-confuses" class="level2" data-number="2.5">
<h2 data-number="2.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="elegant-variation-confuses"><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Elegant variation confuses…</h2>
<p>When there are multiple ways to say the same thing, one should not cycle through the different options for “elegant variation” because the use of a different word to a Reader can suggest something different is happening. For example, if a scientist is working on ‘copepods’, it is best to use this consistently throughout the paper, rather than referring to them variedly as ‘small crustaceans’, ‘zooplankton’, ‘maxillopodes’, ‘arthropods’, and ‘insects of the sea’, as the Reader will wonder if the author means different things by the different terms.</p>
<p>In the following example, the Author has switched from using ‘measurement types’ and ‘ecological traits’ to ‘measurement attributes’ and ‘ecological characters’, making the Reader wonder if it is the same quantities being described.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> Predictors were divided into two categories: measurement types and ecological traits. For measurement attributes we considered the frequency of sampling. For ecological characters we used a global database.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> Predictors were divided into two categories: measurement types and ecological traits. For measurement types we considered the frequency of sampling. For ecological traits we used a global database.</p>
<p>The following example uses ‘influenced’ and ‘described’ in similar contexts, leaving the Reader wondering whether the author meant to highlight such a difference.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> While the abundance of pelagic fish is <em>influenced</em> by food availability and reproduction, their movement is <em>described</em> by oceanographic variables.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.8" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="confusing-word-pairs"><span class="header-section-number">4.8</span> Confusing word pairs</h2>
<p>Here are some confusing word pairs and how to select the correct word.</p>
<p><em><strong>‘A’</strong></em> vs <em><strong>‘an’</strong></em></p>
<p>We know that ‘a’ is used before a word starting with a consonant, and ‘an’ is used before a word starting with a vowel. But, which sounds better?</p>
<p>“An university degree” or “A university degree”?</p>
<p>Here even though ‘university’ starts with a vowel, the ‘u’ makes the sound of the consonant ‘y’ (as in ‘yellow’) and thus sounds better with an ‘a’. So the rule that ‘an’ should precede words that start with a vowel is a generalization that does not cover all situations. An addendum to this rule is that ‘a’ should precede words where the first letter makes the sound of a consonant. Similarly, ‘an’ should precede words where the first letter makes the sound of a vowel.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that some writers use “a hypothesis” and others use “an hypothesis”. We prefer using “a hypotheisis”.</p>

<p>Although some authors use these interchangeably, careful writers distinguish them. Aims (and similarly goals) are general statements and are usually long- term or big picture. Objectives are specific, concrete statements that are often short-term, and can follow the SMART framework (Specific, Measurable, Accurate, Reasonable and Time-bound). Aims are often strategic in nature whereas objectives are more tactical.</p>

<p>‘Altogether’ means ‘overall’ or ‘completely’. ‘All together’ pertains to a group and means ‘everyone’ or everything-together’.</p>
<p>One way of assessing which to use is to test the sentence without the word ‘all’. If the sentence remains intact and comprehensible without ‘all’, it means the appropriate adverb is ‘all together’. If it no longer makes sense after ‘all’ has been removed, ‘altogether’ should be used.</p>

<p>‘Complement’ means ‘something that completes or brings to perfection.’ A <em>compliment</em> is an expression of praise. Almost all scientific uses are ‘complement’.</p>

<p><strong>‘Comprise’/‘Consist of’/‘Composed of’ vs ‘Constitute’</strong> “Comprise”, “consist of”, and “composed of” are synonymous and all mean “is made up of”. By contrast, constitute means “makes up”</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The nucleus <em>comprises</em> protons and neutrons. <strong>Example:</strong> The nucleus <em>consists of</em> protons and neutrons. <strong>Example:</strong> The nucleus is <em>composed of</em> protons and neutrons. <strong>Example:</strong> Protons and neutrons <em>constitute</em> the nucleus.</p>
<p>You could say that the parts ‘constitute’ the whole, and the whole ‘comprises’ or ‘consists of’ or is ‘composed of’ the parts. Note that you never say ‘composed of’.</p>

<p>‘Effect’ and ‘affect’ are probably the two words that are regularly confused in scientific writing. ‘Affect’ is a verb meaning ‘to influence’. ‘Effect’ is usually a noun meaning result, but it can also (more rarely) be used as a verb meaning to cause. ‘Effect’ as a noun is followed by the preposition ‘on’ and preceded by an article (‘a’, ‘an’, ‘the’).</p>

<p>These verbs all have somewhat similar meanings, but there are nuanced differences. They are generally not used interchangeably. It is worthwhile giving some thought to which is appropriate in different circumstances, but one should not cycle through the different options for “elegant variation” because the use of a different word to a Reader can suggest something different is happening. Although it is difficult to give hard-and-fast rules, and it can be slightly different depending on discipline, but here are some rules-of-thumb.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.21" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="measured"><span class="header-section-number">4.21</span> Measured</h2>
<p>Measured is used when a relatively simple instrument is used to make a measurement. Although in the following examples it is correct grammatically to use estimated, quantified, assessed, quantified or determined instead of measured, measured is more appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> We measured the temperature of seawater using a thermometer.</p>

<p>Mixing these two is a very common mistake in scientific writing.</p>
<p><em>Led</em> is the past tense and past participle of the verb <em>to lead</em> (rhymes with <em>bead</em>). Lead (rhymes with <em>bead</em>) is a noun referring to an initiative or a position at the front.</p>

<p>“Maybe” is an adverb and refers to a choice. “Maybe” means “perhaps” when used as an adverb and denotes a choice. A simple trick of finding out if you have used “maybe” in the right place is by interchanging “maybe” with “perhaps.” The sentence should refer to a choice and make sense.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> The jellyfish collected by the Continuous Plankton Recorder are primarily epipelagic, but <em>may be</em> not neustonic.</p>

<p><strong>It is:</strong> A decline of mud content in sediments took place over extensive areas, <em>maybe</em> because of the removal of all mussel beds around 1990.</p>
<p>“May be” is a verb and refers to a possibility. The way to check if “may be” is correct, is to substitute “could be” or “would be” in its place. If it makes sense, the usage is correct.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> It maybe difficult to separate from’ ‘Coelenterate tissue’’ if the bell is not found.</p>

<p>There is not much difference, but careful writers prefer ‘past’. This is because ‘last’ can have the connotation of finality; there can be nothing after the last. It is thus preferable to use ‘past’ when referring to the period of time leading up to the present.</p>

<p>‘Practice’ is a noun referring to the application of an idea (‘the practice of science’), the exercise of a profession (‘he left scientific practice’), customary procedure (‘it was common practice’), or repeated exercise or performance (‘knowing his times table required a lot of practice’)</p>
<p>‘Practise’ is a verb meaning to perform an activity or skill repeatedly to improve one's proficiency (‘He practised his dissection techniques’, or to observe or work at something (‘She practises science’)</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> You can practise your grammar at English Practice.</p>

<p>‘Principle’ is always a noun and is a ‘basic truth’ or ‘rule’</p>
<p>‘Principal’ can be an adjective or a noun. As an adjective it means ‘most important’. As a noun it means an “administrator” or “sum of money’. Note that when principal is used as a noun (e.g.&nbsp;<em>principal</em> of a school or the <em>principal</em> of a loan), it is the shortened form of a phrase (‘<em>principal teacher</em>’ or ‘<em>principal</em> sum’).</p>
<p><em>Hint:</em> A useful way to remember which one to use is: “If you can substitute ‘main’ (which contains an ‘a’), use <em>principal</em> (which also contains an ‘a’). If you can substitute ‘rule’ (which ends in ‘le’), use <em>principle</em> (which also ends in ‘le’) (William and Mary Morris, <em>Harper Dictionary of Contemporary Usage</em>. Harper &amp; Row, 1975).</p>

<p>These are interchangeable. US and Canadian writers ‘towards’ and British and other English writers prefer ‘towards’. The same is true for ‘backwards/fowards’ and ‘backward/forward’ when used as adverb in the UK and US respectively. But when used as an adverb ‘Something is backward compatible’ or ‘She is forward- looking’, then it never has an ‘s’.</p>

<p>Think about whether the sentence is talking about space or time. For example:</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> “Where <em>M. birostris</em> were observed with their cephalic fins firmly rolled up and not engaging in any other activity, behaviour was designated as cruising.”</p>

<h3 data-number="4.23.14" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="which-vs-that"><span class="header-section-number">4.23.14</span> ‘Which’ vs ‘That’</h3>
<p>Distinguishing these two words can help to make intended relationships unmistakable, which is important in reporting scientific information. If the clause can be omitted without leaving the modified noun incomplete, use which and enclose the clause within commas or parentheses; otherwise, use that.</p>
<p>Careful users of English distinguish the two. A ‘that’ should be used before a restrictive clause and ‘which’ before a non-restrictive clause. A restrictive clause is one that defines the situation and cannot be removed. A non-restrictive clause is separated by commas and is an additional piece of information that can be removed from the sentence without altering the meaning.</p>
<p>For example, which of the following is correct:</p>
<p>“Chickens that are well fed produce many eggs” “Chickens, which are well fed, produce many eggs” “Chickens which are well fed produce many eggs”</p>
<p>The 1st one is correct, because only chickens that are well fed will produce many eggs. In the 2nd sentence, removing the ‘which are well fed’ separated by commas, leaves us with a sentence ‘Chickens produce many eggs’ that has a different meaning to the first sentence and is untrue (chickens produce no eggs when they are starving). In the 3rd sentence, it is better to replace the ‘which’ with ‘that’, as a clause with ‘which’ should be separated by commas and it is not then the restrictive clause that is needed here. Here is another example:</p>
<p>“Copepods that are the world’s most abundant metazoans are ubiquitous.” “Copepods, which are the world’s most abundant metazoans, are ubiquitous.” “Copepods which are the world’s most abundant metazoans are ubiquitous.” Here the 2nd one is correct. The ‘which are the world’s most abundant metazoans’ is a non-restrictive clause, and removing this clause does not change the meaning of the sentence ‘Copepods are ubiquitous’.</p>
<p>Although this might seem to be splitting hairs (or setae in the case of copepods!), it helps the Reader more easily follow your writing.</p>

<p>Apostrophes are used to show the omission of a letter or letters in a contraction, and to indicate possession. The possessive case causes the most problems. The following guidelines apply:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Singular nouns are made possessive by adding an apostrophe and an ‘s’ at the end of them, even if they end in an ‘s’ or ‘ss’:</li>
</ol>
<p>The manta’s feeding area (the feeding area belongs to the manta) The student’s thesis (the thesis belongs to the student)</p>
<p>The pus’s colour (the colour belongs to the pus)</p>
<p>The moss’s growth (the growth belongs to the moss)</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Plural nouns (e.g.&nbsp;multiple animals) that end in ‘s’ (which is most plurals) are made possessive by adding an apostrophe without an ‘s’:</li>

<p>The mantas’ feeding area (the feeding area belongs to multiple mantas).</p>
<p>The fishes’ tank (the tank belongs to the fish)</p>
<p>The students' theses (the theses belong to the students)</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Plural nouns that do not end in ‘s’ are made possessive by adding an apostrophe with an ‘s’:</li>
</ol>
<p>The people’s conference (the conference belonging to the people) The sheep’s brains (the brains belonging to the sheep)</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>There is an exception to #1. If the singular and plural of a noun both end in an ‘s’, the possessive for both is then formed by adding an apostrophe only:</li>
</ol>
<p>The species’ status is endangered (the status belonging to species)</p>
<p>Rabies’ cases were increasing (the cases belonging to rabies)</p>
<p>In the case of a noun where both forms end in an ‘s’, it may be necessary to reword the sentence to clarify whether you are referring to a singular or plural noun:</p>

<h3 data-number="4.24.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="commas"><span class="header-section-number">4.24.3</span> Commas</h3>
<p>Commas make your writing more readable and sometimes are essential for correct meaning. A comma is used to break up two clauses where a pause is needed between them. The pause can be used to introduce a new idea or to separate items in a list. A comma often helps to separate clauses that being with “but” or “with”, and at pauses at start of sentences, say after “Similarly,”.</p>
<p>The following sentence is more readable with a comma after “reproduction”.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> While the abundance of pelagic fish is influenced by food availability and reproduction their movement is influenced by oceanographic variables.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> While the abundance of pelagic fish is influenced by food availability and reproduction, their movement is influenced by oceanographic variables.</p>
<p>Similarly, a comma after “live weight” makes the following sentence clearer.</p>
<p>Without the comma after “live weight”, you have to read the first sentence multiple times to understand its meaning.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> As data were expressed in terms of live weight conversion factors were used again to determine the weight of consumable seafood in tonnes.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> As data were expressed in terms of live weight, conversion factors were used to determine the weight of consumable seafood in tonnes.</p>
<p>Often a comma is needed for clarity in a list when there are multiple “ands”. In the following, the comma after “flows” makes the list much easier to read.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> The tidal range, flood and ebb flows and reef morphology create patterns in zooplankton accumulation and productivity around islands.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> The tidal range, flood and ebb flows, and reef morphology create patterns in zooplankton accumulation and productivity around islands.</p>
<p>Sometimes the meaning of a sentence can be changed entirely depending on if and where a comma is used.</p>
<p><strong>Version 1:</strong> While this hypothesis has not been formally tested, at least for Irukandji it appears to be fairly reliable. (The hypothesis has not been tested but appears to be reliable for Irukandji)</p>
<p><strong>Version 2:</strong> While this hypothesis has not been formally tested, at least for the Irukandji <em>Carukia barnesi</em>, it does appear to be fairly reliable. (The hypothesis has not been tested for Irukandji, but it appears reliable for other species)</p>
<p>And one last example to illustrate that you can get yourself into real trouble with the (mis)-use of commas. This appeared in the Times, intended as a description of a Peter Ustinov documentary:</p>
<p><strong>Hmmm:</strong> Highlights of his global tour include encounters with Nelson Mandela, an 800-year-old demigod and a dildo collector.</p>

<p>Historically writers have used two spaces after a fullstop, but now the norm is to use one space. This is the standard in scientific journals. It also makes your work a bit shorter, which is always good. You can search for two spaces and replace with one space once ready to submit.</p>
<p>Most journals use a space between numbers and units. Usually journals do not leave a space between the number and units of °C, %, °N, °S, °E, °W.</p>

<p>Hyphening of compound or unit modifiers is often needed to clarify what is modifying what.

<p>There is a tendency in scientific writing to have long, complex sentences, making it difficult for the Reader to follow. Your work will be cited more if you use shorter and more understandable sentences. If you need to have a long sentence, follow it with a short sentence to give the Reader a rest.</p>
<p>One way of assessing how convoluted your writing is, is to use a Fog Index. Gunnings’s Fog Index is the best known and measures the level of reading difficulty of any document. It is an estimate of the education grade/year that a Reader would need to understand your work. It can be calculated at <a href="http://gunning-fog-index.com/index.html"><u>http://gunning-fog-index.com/index.html</u>.</a></p>
<p>Gunning’s Fog Index = [(average number of words per sentence) + (number of words of 3 syllables or more)] ×&nbsp;0.4</p>
<p>The Bible, Shakespeare and Mark Twain all have Fog Indexes of about 6. Time, Newsweek, and the Wall Street Journal average about 11. Scientific writing has higher Fog Indexes because of the nature of the content, but it is worth calculating yours for different pieces of work and try to reduce it. If your Fog Index soars then you might lose your readers in the fog!</p>
<p>Microsoft Word calculates two other indexes for you. The Flesch Reading Ease Test is on a 100-point scale, with the higher the score the easier it is to read. The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Test rates text on a U.S. school grade level, similar to the Gunnings Fog Index, with a score of 7 meaning that a seventh grader can understand it. You can calculate these directly in your Word documents. In Windows, under Word ‘Options’, click ‘Proofing’, select ‘Check grammar with spelling’, and under ‘When correcting grammar in Word’ select ‘Show readability statistics check box’. For a Mac, go to Word ‘Preferences’, select ‘Spelling and Grammar’, and check ‘Show readability statistics’. When you then go through and use Tools Spelling and Grammar, Word will give you scores for the Flesch Reading Ease Test and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Test.</p>

<p>Many scientists are reluctant to state facts explicitly, constantly couching expressions in vague terms. Maybe the logic is that if you are not making definitive statements then you can never be wrong. However, this means you end up saying very little, and what you do say confuses rather than informs. Remember words cost money for a journal (in terms of space) so be concise. A key skill in science is to be clear what we know and state those explicitly, and what we suspect/think and couch those more carefully. Many times, explicit statements are much clearer.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> Some reef fish are known to farm algae, which shifts the benthos from a bare surface to an algal covered benthos.</p>

<p><strong>Try:</strong> Fish and invertebrates can move deeper as oceans warm.</p>
<p>In the next example, did the researchers “aim to investigate” the problem, or did they actually “investigate” the problem?</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> Here we aimed to investigate the interaction between whale shark feeding ecology and characteristics of the zooplankton community.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> Here we investigated the relationship between whale shark feeding ecology and the zooplankton community.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> There is very little difference of the impact of the different scenarios on evenness.</p>

<p>Sentences can often be made clearer and shorter by removing redundant and superfluous words. In the following sentence, the last clause “but this remains undemonstrated” is redundant, as it is implied by the third clause “has been hypothesized to cause illness”.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> One species in the genus Carybdea, the Australian form of <em>Carybdea xaymacana</em>, has been hypothesised to cause illness, but this remains undemonstrated.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> One species in the genus Carybdea, the Australian form of <em>Carybdea xaymacana</em>, has been hypothesised to cause illness.</p>
<p>In the following example, there is no need to give coordinates when you refer to a map in a figure.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> The region was subsetted into five discrete 5° latitudinal by 5° longitudinal cells for analyses (Figure 1). The five regions included the north- south latitudinal gradient with the following coordinates; region 1, 20°S to 25°S, 20°S, 155°E to 160°E; region 2, 25°S to 30°S, 155°E to 160°E; region 3, 30°S to 35°S, 155°E to 160°E; region 4, 35°S to 40°S, 152.5°E to 157.5°E; and region 5, 40°S to 45°S, 150°E to 155°E.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> The region was subsetted into five 5° latitudinal by 5° longitudinal cells for analyses (Figure 1).</p>
<p>In the next example, it is best not to refer back to previous sections of your work (e.g., as described/discussed/mentioned above, as described/discussed/mentioned previously), because it is vague, as you know exactly where, but your Readers do not. You should either assume people have read it or be more explicit about what you are referring to. The same goes for referring to something below.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.26.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="active-vs-passive-voice"><span class="header-section-number">4.26.3</span> Active vs Passive voice</h3>
<p>There are two voices in English – active and passive. The active voice is often more direct, clearer and vivid, and is preferred for scientific writing and giving instructions. However, the passive voice is preferred when the subject of the sentence is implied, indefinite, general, unimportant, or if the writer is trying to increase vagueness or suspense. The passive voice often uses the word ‘by’ and is usually longer. The active voice often used personal pronouns (I, We, His, Her, Us). Historically, it has been frowned upon to use personal pronouns in scientific writing, perhaps because science should be independent of personal biases and detached from the researchers themselves. We are often taught in our undergraduate studies that using personal pronouns in scientific writing is anathema and many traditional scientists still reject it.</p>
<p>In more recent years, however, there has been a push toward using the active rather than the passive voice in scientific writing because it is more direct and shorter. Our advice is to write in the active voice and use personal pronouns wherever you need to. Occasionally you will get an Editor who might not like it, but this is increasingly rare. If you do strike an Editor who does not like it, change it. Microsoft Word will highlight passive sentences and help you change them.</p>
<p>Examples of passive vs active voice follow. Which voice do you prefer?</p>
<p>##Passive:## Gravity was discovered by Galileo. <em>Here ‘Gravity’ is the subject, ‘Galileo’ is the object and ‘was discovered by’ is the verb.</em></p>

<p>##Passive 1:## An ecosystem model was constructed by us. <em>Here ‘an ecosystem model’ is the subject, ‘us’ is the object, and ‘was constructed by’ is the verb.</em></p>
<p>##Passive 2:## An ecosystem model was constructed. <em>As above, but the object “us” is implied.</em></p>
<p>##Active:## We constructed an ecosystem model. <em>Here ‘We’ is the subject, ‘an ecosystem model’ is the object, and ‘constructed’ is the verb.</em></p>

<p>It is usually best to use a logical sequence in a sentence, wherever possible. For example, in time (e.g., February before March), space (e.g., describe sites from North to South), phylogenetically (e.g., from simple to complex), or importance (e.g., human stresses on ecosystems that are most to least harmful). When this is not possible, alphabetical order is a good option.</p>

<p>Topic sentence and concluding sentences in paragraphs – not appropriate in fictional writing.</p>
<p>The 1st sentence of a paragraph should summarize the paragraph. Thus if you want to skim a paper, you should be able to read the 1st sentence of each paragraph and follow the logic of the paper. This means that when writing a paragraph, keep in mind that it should give the overall message of the paragraph.</p>
<p>Paragraphs should also not be too long. The longer the paragraph, the more difficult it is for the Reader to follow the message, and the more likely the Writer is to meander. Short, punchy paragraphs will best convey your messages.</p>
<p>Here it is useful to separate the single long paragraph into two shorter paragraphs so the Reader does not get the impression that you are saying the same thing twice – it emphasises that one analysis is for Biomass and the other one is for Abundance.</p>

<p>The use of lists highlights a difference between writing in novels and scientific/technical writing. In a novel, there are never boring, repetitive lists that would lose Readers’ interest. In scientific and technical writing, however, lists are often vital for helping the Reader follow a complex argument or know all the different causes. Only use lists when there are three or more items: two items can just be explained one after the other and the Reader can easily follow. Lists are normally introduced with a sentence that states there are few/several/many explanations/reasons/steps for something.</p>

<p>The Irish playwright Oscar Wilde described America and Britain as “<em>two nations divided by the same language</em>.” Many of the differences between US and British spelling were championed by the American teacher and lexicographer Noah Webster in the early 19th century. He saw the simplification of English spelling as a mark of American independence. Commonwealth nations generally follow British English. Although traditionally British journals have used British English and American journal American English, journals are usually flexible these days with whether you use British or US English. However, the most important advice is to be consistent in your usage. The best ways to do this are to be familiar with different forms, and to choose the English version on your spell checker in your word processor!</p>

<p>The following is a table summarising differences between British and US English, focusing on scientific terms. Some rules are not hard and fast, English is a dynamic language so spelling is in a state of flux.</p>
